This page is based on the paper: [[Horsten_Having_an_Interpretation.pdf]] by [L. Horsten](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/horsten/leon-horsten/). Arguments against some of the theses sustained by Prof. Horsten are available here [Overleaf: Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gcprybycmxcd#3445a7) and here [[Remarks_on__Having_an_Interpretation_.pdf]]. In the same file, the second section presents consequences I derived from structuralism which I could not find in the literature. 

I plan to contact Prof. Horsten to get clarification on the points presented and discuss my arguments.
#### Abstract
I divide the document into two sections, in the first I argue against some theses present in the article, in particular: relevance of the _reference fixing question_, the _social theory of reference_ and the missing reference of unobservables in _empirical structuralism_. The second section contains a brief exposition of consequences in philosophy of logic which I see to follow directly from ontological structuralism but to which I did not find any reference yet.
