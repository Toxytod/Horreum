I have been a student of the first year (2022 - 2023) in the [[B.A. Philosophy (LMU)]] at the University of Constance and took part to three courses with Prof. Horsten:
- _Kripke_ in which I wrote [[The Frequency of Telling Stories]]
- _Epistemology_
- _GÃ¶del_ in which I wrote [[A Priori's Division of Knowledge]]

I met him again in Pisa for a serie of conferences in Philosophy of Set Theory in 2023, I also planned to participate to a Summer School in Vienna in September 2024 but I finally couldn't join.
