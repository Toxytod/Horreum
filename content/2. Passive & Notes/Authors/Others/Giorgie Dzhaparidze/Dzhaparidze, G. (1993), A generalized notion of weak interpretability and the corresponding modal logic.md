The paper can be downloaded from [here](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82545948.pdf), here I collect some comments on it. This is one of the sources I use to connect my [[B.A. Philosophy Thesis]] to the literature. I will therefore often make comparisons with my work and definitions.

##### Introduction
There are two definitions from the past papers by Tarski that are relevant here: 

For theories $T$ and $S$ we say "$T$ interprets $S$" if there is a translation $\tau: \mathcal{L}_S \to \mathcal{L}_T$ s.t. $\forall_{\varphi \in \mathcal{L}_S} S \vdash \varphi \to T \vdash \tau(\varphi)$. This exactly resembles my notion of _Partial Translation_ of the theory $T$. Here what I call _Logic_ are called "Languages".
