I discussed tthe beginning of this paper with Enrico Cinti at the ILLC for the Interview of the course [[Logic, Language and Computation (Lecture)]]. I took my notes on the matter in here [Overleaf: LoLaCo, Int. 1](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rmvgfdpgwcbb#3da1f7). There I connected with:
- [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)]]
- [[Correspondence]]
- [[Structure on Models]]
- [[Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation]]
- [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]]
- [[Bachelor Thesis]]
