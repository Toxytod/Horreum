### Papers to Read in Interpretability Theory
I first got interested into this topic through my [[B.A. Philosophy Thesis]] in which I naively discovered the core concept already presented by Tarski. After noticing it thanks to the [[B.A. Philosophy Thesis#Comment by Prof. Leitgeb & Email]] to my [[B.A. Philosophy Thesis]].
