# PassiveEndNodes

This page serves as an index of all the materials and resources available in the "PassiveEndNodes" folder. The folder primarily focuses on my academic experiences, including detailed notes on the universities I have attended and the authors I have studied. Below you will find an organised overview of these sections, providing insight into the institutions and thinkers that have shaped my intellectual journey.

## Universities

In this section, I list and provide details of the universities I have been a part of. Each university entry contains my personal reflections, notable courses, and any relevant academic milestones during my time there. Links to the specific pages for each university will be included.

   - Currently enrolled in the M.Sc. Logic programme.
   - Detailed notes on the courses, professors, and projects I am involved with.
