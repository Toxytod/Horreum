In this page I show the passages I followed to find a room in Amsterdam. First of all, I start by the [Housing](https://www.uva.nl/en/education/practical-information/housing/housing.html) page of the UvA. I am starting the research for a room on 29.02 and the program starts on 01.09.
## Active Research
Here I collect the websites or opportunities I found in which I can actively look for rooms, visit ecc.
#### [Room.nl](https://www.room.nl/en/)
It certainly is one of the biggest websites to find rooms in Amsterdam, though tehre seem not to be anything useful yet for my dates, apartements are only available from the end of March, i.e. abount a month from now.

 An option would be to contact each of the buildings singularly and ask for availability from August/Sempteber, I will consider this option if there isn't anything more fruitful. Also, by paying the subcription fee (35€), one will start get offerings of rooms, to which one can respond and hope (1 to 40 -150 people) to get the room. On average the rooms seem to be cheap and nice.
#### Funda
The best option for now is to find 2-4 students willing to share a house with me. In this way we access the general real estate market and not only the one for students which has a far to high demand to find something with a decent value.
## Passive Research
Here I collect those websites and opportunities in which there is nothing I can do to get better chances, other than simply registering to a mailing list or waiting up to a certain date.
#### [UvA Student Housing](https://www.uva.nl/en/education/practical-information/housing/uva-student-housing/uva-student-housing.html)
A option that will be open untill the very last weeks, is the [UvA Student Housing](https://www.uva.nl/en/education/practical-information/housing/uva-student-housing/uva-student-housing.html) thouse certainly are a good option, though they are not granted and selection takes place through a lottery. Applications take place between **29.05**-12.06 but at the end of May all eligible (I am, [link](https://www.uva.nl/en/education/practical-information/housing/what-you-need-to-know/what-you-need-to-know.html)) students are expected to receive an invitation (before mid June, [link](https://www.uva.nl/en/education/practical-information/housing/application-procedure/application-procedure.html#Step-2-Check-your-email-and-spam-folder-for-the-invitation-to-apply-for-student-housing). I suppose then that an eventual confirmation will take place not before the **13.06** i.e. to late to wait for a response without a safe alternative.

I will consider details for this option as dates get closer, there is nothing I can do before receiving the invitation.
#### [OurCampus](https://www.ourcampus.nl/)
They offer rooms in Diemen for about 700€, around 10' with the bike form the Science Park. I got into the interest list though there seems not to be availability in the foreseeable future.
