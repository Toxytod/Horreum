I focused some of the essays on the debate on semantic and syntactic views on theories, which have been briefly exposed in [[Structure on Models]] and [[Philosophy of Physics (essay)]].

More considerations on structuralism in relation with the notion of interpretation are available under [[Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation]], the analysis and discussion of the paper by [L. Horsten](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/horsten/leon-horsten/).
