In the appendix I upload details of any sort regarding the thesis, divided in those regarding the actual content and the relevant bureaucratic informations.
##### Appendix Index
- [[Appendix of the Thesis#Official Submission Form]]: actual submission form for BSc. and BA
- [[Appendix of the Thesis#Time Table]]: detailed time table, tasks list and what will be uploaded
- [[Appendix of the Thesis#Supervisors]]: brief presentation of possible supervisors
### Official Submission Form
Since I want to submit the thesis for both the BSc. Mathematics and the BA Philosophy, I need to split it into two different documents which will be connected by references only to avoid self-plagiarism. The respective documents will be uploaded on [[Mathematics Thesis]] and [[Philosophy Thesis]] and a united version in [[Thesis Home]].
### Time Table
The time dividing now (December 2023) from the submission date (August 2024) can be divided into three areas:
##### Third Semester
The high amount of courses (see [[3rd Semester]]) prevents me to work at any intensity at the thesis even, therefore, instead of doing the more time-consuming tasks like consulting the material , I focus on finding the two right supervisors (see [[Appendix of the Thesis#Supervisors]]). That means that I am focusing on finding the right topic for my thesis and writing questions which I discuss with professors in the field.
##### Break
During the break I will have more time though I will not be able to discuss the material and ideas with the supervisors, therefore I want to have as many technical (hence mathematical) details cleared as possible. In this way I will spend the break on the more philosophical part of the material and want to write the introduction.
##### Fourth Semester
During the fourth semester I foresee having fewer courses than in the third semester (see [[4th Semester]]) and will therefore spend most of it working on the thesis. Also, I plan to present some of the topics of the thesis in the Student Tutorial (see [[Student Tutorial Application]]) which will help be to give a more didactical form to my thesis.
### Supervisors
Since my thesis is in both the Mathematics and Philosophy department I will need a supervisor for each of the involved departments.

For mathematics I already got confirmation and discussed some of the topics with [Prof. Franz Merkl](https://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/TMP/members/mathematics/merkl/index.html), even though he does research in Mathematical Finance and other areas of Applied Mathematics he certainly has the required competence in Logic, I got his name suggested by [Prof, Schwichtenberg](https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/) the only active professor of the logic group who could have otherwise been my supervisor.

For philosophy I plan either to ask to [Prof. Letigeb](https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/) or to [Dr. Dougherty](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/dougherty_john/index.html), both would certainly fit the role and I discussed the thesis with the latter already.
