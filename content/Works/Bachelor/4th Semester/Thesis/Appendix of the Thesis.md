Here I upload details on any sort regarding the Thesis and, in particular, the brueaucratic details.

### Official Submission Form
Since I want to submit the thesis for both the BSc. Mathematics and the BA Philosophy, I need to split it into two different documents which will be connected by references in order to avoid any sort of self-plagiarism. The respective documents will be uploaded on [[Mathematics Thesis]] and [[Philosophy Thesis]].

Self-plagiatism (i.e. deliberately copying previously submitted works outside of quotations) is explicitly prohibited in the Philosophy Thesis (as discussed with Dr. Wyrwich), though it is not clear whether that would constitute a problem for the Mathematics department. For instance, I might be allowed to submit the Philosophy Thesis first containing some proofs that will be part of the Mathematics Thesis.
### Supervisors
Since my thesis is in both the Mathematics and Philosophy department I will need a supervisor for each of the involved departments.

For mathematics I already got confirmation and discussed some of the topics with [Prof. Franz Merkl](https://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/TMP/members/mathematics/merkl/index.html), even though he does research in Mathematical Finance and other areas of Applied Mathematics he certainly has the required competence in Logic, I got his name suggested by [Prof, Schwichtenberg](https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/) the only active professor of the logic group who could have otherwise been my supervisor.

For philosophy I got confirmation from [Dr. Dougherty](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/dougherty_john/index.html), whose content of previous courses perfectly matches the topic of my thesis.
### Time Table
##### Break
During the break I will have more time though I will not be able to discuss the material and ideas with the supervisors, therefore I want to have as many technical (hence mathematical) details cleared as possible. In this way I will spend the break on the more philosophical part of the material and want to write the introduction.
##### [[4th Semester]]
I plan to finish the last parts of the thesis, discuss the arguments and their form in with the supervisors and
present some of the topics of the thesis in the Student Tutorial (see [[Paradoxes of Perspective (Tutorial)]]) which will help be to give a more didactical form to my thesis. Also I am considering to participate to [S2S Talks](https://www.fachschaft.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/studierende/s2stalks/index.html) to present there my thesis project and hopefully get many constructive feedbacks from other students.
