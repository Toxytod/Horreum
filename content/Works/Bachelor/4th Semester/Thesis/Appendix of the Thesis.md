In the appendix I upload details of any sort regarding the thesis, divided in those regarding the actual content and the relevant bureaucratic informations.
##### Appendix Index
- Bureaucracy 
	- [[Appendix of the Thesis#Official Submission Form]]: actual submission form for BSc. and BA
	- [[Appendix of the Thesis#Time Table]]: detailed time table, tasks list and what will be uploaded
- Content
	- [[Appendix of the Thesis#Material]]: possible future references of the thesis
### Official Submission Form
Since I want to submit the thesis for both the BSc. Mathematics and the BA Philosophy, I need to split it into two different documents which will be connected by references only to avoid self-plagiarism. Some bureaucratic questions are still unanswered, I will update on this
### Material
Here I list some of the material I plan to use to write the thesis.
##### Books
- Models and Ultraproducts, J. L. Bell, A. B. 
- Philosophy and Model Theory, T. Button, S. Walsh
##### Articles

### Time Table
The time dividing now (December 2023) from the submission date (August 2024) can be divided into three areas:
##### Third Semester
The high amount of courses (see [[3rd Semester]]) prevents me to work at any intensity at the thesis even, therefore, instead of doing the more time-consuming tasks like consulting the material (see [[Appendix of the Thesis#Material]]), I focus on finding the two right supervisors (see [[Thesis#Supervisors]]). That means that I am focusing on finding the right topic for my thesis and writing questions which I discuss with professors in the field.
##### Break
During the break I will have more time though I will not be able to discuss the material and ideas with the supervisors, therefore I want to have as many technical (hence mathematical) details cleared as possible. In this way I will spend the break on the more philosophical part of the material (see [[Thesis#Material]]) and want to write the introduction.
###### Tasks List
- Write the introduction
- Formalise the previously stated claims
- Begin to prove those formally, collect questions
##### Fourth Semester
During the fourth semester I foresee having fewer courses than in the third semester (see [[4th Semester]]) and will therefore spend most of it working on the thesis.
### Supervisors
I will have one supervisor in the mathematics department and one in the philosophy department, no names in particular have been fixed yet.
