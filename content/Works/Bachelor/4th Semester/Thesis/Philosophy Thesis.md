There are two main assumptions that are required for my argument, here I give a more precise statement of both and present the content that will be part of the thesis.
## Possible Worlds as Mathematical Models
I follow from the Tarskian definition of truth the necessity of considering possible worlds as mathematical models. This argument will be expanded in [[On Models and Worlds]], the essay for the course on Philosophy of Logic, and a revisited version will be added below.
More on the essay I am writing can be found on [Overleaf: Models and Worlds](https://www.overleaf.com/read/phqqbgzxxzks#060e7f).
###### Abstract
The Tarskian definition of logical consequence requires us to consider models within the same formal system of any proposition that we want to prove true. I then expose how the Tarskian Truth definition applied to any sort of empirical sentence requires an analysis of the formal system of possible worlds, considered as models. I then state the question asking which formal language should be regarded as the right one to talk about worlds, and then show the connection with the literature on logical pluralism.

### Modal Realism
For this I will mainly refer to [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/david-lewis/#6) section 6, I plan to only expose the Lewis' argument and show compatibility with [[Philosophy Thesis#Possible Worlds as Mathematical Models]].

### On Ultraproducts
This section will be dedicated to why I regard that ultraproducts of possible worlds are to be regarded as possible worlds as well. I will then analyse the single ultraproducts constructed in [[Mathematics Thesis]] and show what philosophical consequence they imply.
