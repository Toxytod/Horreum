Following the instructions given on the [LMU website](https://www.fachschaft.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/studierende/lektueregruppen/antrag/index.html) I present two different thematics that may be of interest for students passionate about theoretical philosophy and mathematical methods. I am aware (from [here](https://www.fachschaft.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/studierende/lektueregruppen/antrag/selection-criteria.pdf)) that only one of the following tracks could be chosen by the Students' Council and that I am anyway allowed to apply for both of those.

One can certainly find many connections with my [[Philosophy Thesis]]. In the description of the two tracks, together with the content of the course, I also briefly sketch where I got competence in the relative area by quoting further works uploaded on this website. I will then publish the material on a page similar to this one, all that I will publish and handle in the course will be piper or chapters of books that I have already read or that I will read in the break between the semesters. I plan to also upload documents I personally will write, like discussions or particular topics related to discussed papers or, for the second track, a mathematical script.

The first track is a topic of Philosophy of Science while the second is in Philosophy of Mathematics (or applications of Mathematics to Philosophy) and certainly those topics are already present within the offering of the MCMP. What is new in the student tutorial I am offering is, on one hand, accessibility to all bachelor students, who perhaps would not manage to follow more technical courses at the MCMP or simply would prefer to see topics in mathematical philosophy in a shorter, easier and more relaxed form than a complete 9 ECTS course with exam. On the other hand I wish to focus on very precise and concise debates within the broad fields which are usually handled in lectures; this will, I hope, introduce the fellow students quickly to the main questions in the discussion and stimulate an active discussion. Furthermore in both tracks I let the fellow students choose how to spend the second half of the course, which would not be possible in a normal lecture and will, again, stimulate discussion. 
### 1. Structuralism in _"Scientific Representation: Paradoxes of Perspective"_
In this track I plan to focus on some chapters of the Van Fraassen book _"Scientific Representation: Paradoxes of Perspective"_. After an introductory presentation on structuralism and previous crucial passages of the book, we will read 10 to 20 pages per week of the Part III: _Structure and Perspective_ which will take about the first half of the course (about 7 weeks), after that I will let the fellow students choose whether they prefer to pursue with the book into the IV Part: _Appearance and Reality_ or whether they prefer to look into other literature on the same theme, like other chapters or sections of the same book, of _The Scientific Image_ (also by van Fraassen) or other articles discussing the same matter under different perspectives, like [[Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation]].

This topic will be one of the two focuses of my [[Philosophy Thesis]] on which I plan to read more during the break between the semesters, in fact, no matter the Students' Council choice, I plan to read the named literature during that time, this holds for the second track too. I already wrote on this topic in [[On Models and Worlds]] and in the comment to [[Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation]]. I also plan to write [[Categorical Equivalence in Structuralism]] and [[Unobservables in Structuralism]] respectively for the courses _Category Theory for the Working Philosopher_ and _Introduction to Philosophy of Physics_.
### 2. _"Philosophy and Model Theory"_
Requiring not more than the first philosophical logic course, I will spend the first half of the course (about 7 weeks) reading 10 to 15 pages per week of _"Philosophy and Model Theory"_ by T. Button and S. Walsh and, if wished by the students, give a look for more technicalities into _Models and Ultraproducts_ by J. L. Bell and A. B. Slomson. In this track too, I would let the fellow students choose between three different possible ways for the second half of the course: the first is to pursue with further material on the mathematical side of model theory (I will also present some introductory alternatives to the quoted books); the second is to give a look into related topics in set theory and give the basics for the construction of ultraproducts and their application in philosophy (see [[Philosophy Thesis]]); finally the third is to give a look at some applications of model theory in philosophy, one of those would be to go trough some papers on the model theoretic argument by Putnam.

I imagine the introductory material on model theory to become part of my [[Mathematics Thesis]], I will therefore write a script for the occasion and then adapt it for the thesis, the same holds for the introduction to ultraproducts and the applications I mention in [[Philosophy Thesis]]. I got familiar with the mentioned topics thanks to [[Model Theory (Lecture)]] and [[Advanced Set Theory (Lecture)]] in the mathematics department of the University of Constance and to [[Constructive Analysis (Lecture)]] at the LMU. At the MCMP I am also following _Category Theory for the Working Philosopher_ (see [[Categorical Equivalence in Structuralism]]), _Philosophy of Logic_ (see [[On Models and Worlds]]) and _Modal Logic_.
