title: The Silent Assumption in Tarskian Semantics
---

In the course on Philosophy of Logic by [Dr. A. Marra](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/marra_alessandra/index.html) I will submit an essay on mathematical models and possible worlds. For context see [[Philosophy Thesis]]. Updates on the work can be found on [Overleaf: Models and Worlds](https://www.overleaf.com/read/phqqbgzxxzks#060e7f).

###### Abstract
After some observations on the application of Tarskian Semantic to empirical statements, I argue for the equality of the interpretational and representational account. I start by showing an intuitive way to apply Tarskian Semantics to empirical statements by using some arguments in the Philosophy of Science, I then show how Tarskian Semantics requires a weak form of scientific structuralism. Finally I conclude by showing how scientific structuralism does not allow a proper distinction of interpretational and representational account.
