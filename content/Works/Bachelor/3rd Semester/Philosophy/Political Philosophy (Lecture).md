I followed this lecture during the #3rd_Semester at the #LMU. I collect here brief and mostly disconnected notes which should give an overview of the themes covered during the lecture. Falling the theme of the lecture outside of my area of interest, I am most concise and do not go in any remarkable depth.

**Theorem** ([Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Condorcet) Jury Theorem): Assumed (i) classical competence (probability of each agent to get the right answer is greater than 0,5) and (ii) classical independency (agents do not influence each other choices), then bigger the population, greater the probability that a democratic process gives the right answer and it converges to 1.

Counter argument: false assumption, (ii) is never the case in a realistic population
