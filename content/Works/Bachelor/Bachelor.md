For a complete list of the my works during the bachelor, visit [[Index of all Works]], in this page I collect general considerations on my first two years of study.

In the first two years of university I plan to get a BSc in Mathematics and a BA in Philosophy at the LMU Munich. I see two features of my early studies, which are distinguished from the average passionate student in my field: [[Bachelor#The Amount of ECTS in Brief Time]] and [[Bachelor#The Variety of Competence Acquired]]. Here I will briefly examine these two aspects and then report the present data on the final mark.
## The Amount of ECTS in Brief Time
Let's begin with a couple of numbers. I divide the ECTS in those that have been necessary to obtain the BA Philosophy or the BSc Mathematics and those which I followed for my own pleasure, for clarity I kept the two lists with empty intersection. I also separated with the "+" the credits for the [[Thesis Home]], since I worked on it during the brake between the semesters.

| Semester      | Phil. | Math. | Pleasure | Total|
| :---        |  :----: |   :----: |:----:| :----:|
| [[1st Semester]] | 24 | 24 | 6 |54|
| [[2nd Semester]] | 42 | 33 | 0 | 75|
| [[3rd Semester]] | 27 | 36 | 18 | 81|
| [[4th Semester]] | 6 + 21 | 45 + 12 | 39 | 123|
|Total | 120 | 150 | 63 | 333 |
#### How is that possible?
The combination of the two studies, allowed me to have a the load of work distributed during the semester: most of the seminars in Philosophy require an essay which can be either completed long time before the deadline, i.e. in the first half of the semester, or one can start working on it in the last month before the deadline, which at the LMU (contrary to the Uni Konstanz) is about two months after the end of the semester. Both of these times are sufficiently far from the period of the Mathematics exams, which take place one to three weeks after the end of the lectures. 
#### Why this hurry?
On one hand I am driven by the passion in the field and am willing to spend considerable part of my time to discover it. On the other hand I have been used, from my years in the high school (see [[index#School Years]]), to study different things than what was required, I believe that this taught me to calibrate the workload on my own limits rather than what is suggested. I also like to experiment with myself and testing my limits, this also drove me to constantly increase the workload each semester.
## The Variety of Competence Acquired
During my bachelors I came in contact with Analysts, Historians of Philosophy, Algebraists, Metaphysicians, Computer Scientists, etc... who taught me something of their fields, while I cannot say to have appreciated each of these in the same manner, I believe I got a decent education in a very broad variety of fields. This wide background allowed me to see how one may connect Ancient Philosophers to issues in Computer Science or in Contemporary Physics and discuss these subjects with people competent in each of these areas. But what I value most with  my Bachelor is the competence acquired in the very tiny cavity of Mathematical Philosophy, which inevitably requires a similar background.
#### Final Mark
Currently it is hard to make estimation on the final mark of any of the two subjects, since there are sill about half of the marks missing. Though I aim to averaging 1.5 in both degrees for obtaining the _Summa cum Laude_, the highest distinction in Germany (see [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_cum_laude)). A precise list of the courses can be found in [[Marks LMU.pdf]].
