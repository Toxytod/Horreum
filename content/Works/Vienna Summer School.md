Here I collect notes on the [European Summer School in the Philosophy of Mathematics 2024]([https://summerschool-ivc.univie.ac.at](https://summerschool-ivc.univie.ac.at/)).
## Application
According to the [guidelines](https://summerschool-ivc.univie.ac.at/application/) I list here the required documents together with the letter of motivation:
- [[Letter_of_Motivation.pdf]]
- [[Transcript of Records Contance.pdf]]
- Reference: [Prof. Horsten](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/horsten/leon-horsten/)
In "The copy of my last degree" I upload the Transcript of Records again, since I suppose that the [[High School Diploma.pdf]] is not of any interest.
#### Letter of Motivation
I am a student at the LMU Munich in both BA Philosophy and BSc. Mathematics in my third and last semester (for more details on my studies see [[Curriculum_Vitae.pdf]]), even though my academic experience is definitely limited, I have had different encounters with Philosophy of Mathematics. First of all, I chose to enrol in both Bachelor's degrees since I wanted to have all the background required to begin my studies in Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic, and from the very first year (which I had the pleasure to spend at the University of Constance) I visited some courses on the topic, in particular:
- "Paradoxes: truth, infinity and time travel" by [Prof. Roberts](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/en/ag-leon-horsten/members-of-the-ag-horsten/academic-staff/sam-roberts/), with an essay entitled [[Issues on Real Numbers]]
- "Kripke" by [Prof. Horsten](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/horsten/leon-horsten/), with an essay entitled [[The Frequency of Telling Stories]], which is not focussed in Philosophy of Mathematics but certainly gives some necessary foundations

And in the mathematics department:
- [[Model Theory (Lecture)]]
- [[Advanced Set Theory (Lecture)]]

In the current year, at the LMU, I am following other related courses like:
- "Philosophy of Logic" by Dr. Marra [[The Silent Assumption in Tarskian Semantics]]
- "Category Theory for the Working Philosopher" by Dr. Dougherty [[Structure on Models]]
- "Philosophy of Physics" by Dr. Dougherty [[Correspondence]]

I currently got admitted to the MSc. in Logic at the ILLC of the University of Amsterdam and have applied to the [DPhil Mathematics](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-mathematics) at Oxford, by the time of the Summer School I plan to be a student of either of the two institutions.

Other than enjoying again the lectures of Prof. Horsten, all themes presented in the website are of crucial relevance for either my MSc at the ILLC or my PhD at Oxford.

In my current transcript of records only some of the quoted courses appear, since I am currently requesting to get into the double major program for my last semester at the LMU. I therefore upload the most comprehensive Transcript of Records I have, namely the one at the University of Constance, all courses I took at the LMU this semester (see [[3rd Semester]]) are missing; the courses I will take in the upcoming semester (i.e. before the summer school) are linked here [[4th Semester]].
