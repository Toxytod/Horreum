Here I collect notes on the [European Summer School in the Philosophy of Mathematics 2024]([https://summerschool-ivc.univie.ac.at](https://summerschool-ivc.univie.ac.at/)).
## Application
According to the [Guidelines](https://summerschool-ivc.univie.ac.at/application/) I list here the required documents together with the letter of motivation:

#### Letter of Motivation
I am a student at the LMU Munich in both BA Philosophy and BSc. Mathematics in my third and last semester (for more details on my studies see [[Curriculum_Vitae.pdf]]), even though my academic experience is definitely limited, I have had different encounters with Philosophy of Mathematics. First of all, I chose to enroll in both Bachelor's degrees since I wanted to have all the background required to begin my studies in Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic, and from the very first year (which I had the pleasure to spend at the University of Constance) I visited some courses on the topic, in particular:
- "Paradoxes: truth, infinity and time travel" by [Prof. Roberts](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/en/ag-leon-horsten/members-of-the-ag-horsten/academic-staff/sam-roberts/), with an essay entitled [[Issues on Real Numbers]]
- "Kripke" by [Prof. Horsten](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/horsten/leon-horsten/), with an essay entitled [[The Frequency of Telling Stories]], which is not focussed in Philosophy of Mathematics but certainly gives some necessary foundations.
And in the mathematics department:
- [[Model Theory (Lecture)]]
- [[Advanced Set Theory (Lecture)]]
In the current year, at the LMU, I am following other related courses like:
- "Philosophy of Logic" by Dr. Marra [[On Models and Worlds]]
- "Category Theory for the Working Philosopher" by Dr. Dougherty [[Categorical Equivalence in Structuralism]]
- "Philosophy of Physics" by Dr. Dougherty [[Unobservables in Structuralism]]
I currently got admitted to the MSc. in Logic at the ILLC of the University of Amsterdam and have applied to the [DPhil Mathematics](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-mathematics) at Oxford, by the time of the Summer School I plan to be a student of either of the two institutions.
