I have been a student of the first year (2022 - 2023) in the BA Philosophy at the University of Constance and took part to three courses with Prof. Horsten:
- _Kripke_ in which I wrote [[The Frequency of Telling Stories]]
- _Epistemology_
- _GÃ¶del_ in which I wrote [[A Priori's Division of Knowledge]]

I participate to the [[Vienna Summer School]] (September 2024) where Prof. Horsten is one of the three lecturers.
