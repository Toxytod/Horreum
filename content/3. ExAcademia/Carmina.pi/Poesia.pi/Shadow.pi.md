##### Genesis
As you know, I just come out of a relationship I enjoyed with all my heart but that I would not repeat. I see several similarities in the my behaviour with you and I don't know how much that directly depends on me. I suspect to be biased but I will need some thinking and, most of all, advice from who is external and knows me best to realise whether that is the case \[this refers to a talk with Makki\].

Several of the things I loved already, I see them again (I guess even more intensively) and know I could love them again, I don't doubt it would be very easy to fall in love with you. As I said, I am not sure I want any "again", anything similar of what I experienced already.
