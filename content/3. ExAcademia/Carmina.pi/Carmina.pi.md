In this folder I collect all poems I wrote, most of those, up to now, are dated in my [[index#School Years]]. Apart from very few exceptions (collected under the tag #engpi) I wrote and write poems in Italian, sometimes an introduction or analysis in English is given. I will, as I feel natural, mostly use English as the technical language while Italian will remain the language enabling me to use more complex syntax, metrics and a free choice in the lexicon. Some writings (like [[Tralle Liquide.pi]]) require some basics in Ancient Greek, Latin and German (see. [[index#School Years]]). The literary references are mostly to Italian ([[Books Index.bo#Dante]], [[Books Index.bo#D'Annunzio]], [[Books Index.bo#Pirandello]], [[Books Index.bo#Svevo]] and German ([[Books Index.bo#Goethe]], [[Books Index.bo#Kafka]]) literature.

Any other document not concerning my academic career or focus is denoted by a specific ending, `.pi` in the case of poems and brief prosas. An introduction to the collection of all old poems is given in [[28.03.24, Nardin.pi]], in here I list only those poems written before and immediately after Ari left me; recent and future poems will be collected elsewhere (for now only [[Stagione.pi]] and [[Yet to be Uncovered.pi]]). Poems that are not given a title, are named by date and place.
