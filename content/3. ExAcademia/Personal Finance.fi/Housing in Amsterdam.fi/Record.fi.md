#### 02.06.2024, Message
After not getting an answer to the previous question and fining out that the [[House in Amsterdam.fi]] is not suitable for the B&B (see [[Airbnb in Amsterdam.fi#Legal Constrains]]). Therefore I decided to try with the alternative plan: [[Fictional Sublet.fi]], in order to make this plan work the agreement of the landlord is essential and therefore I send today the following message:

Good afternoon, I thought more regarding the reservation and sublet options I exposed during the last call and message and came to some different conclusions that may turn out to be easier for you to accept; we can discuss them in a call too but here you find them summarised.
I would rent the house together with other students or young people I am in contact with, the contract though should be structured so that I, on one hand, I can make the prices for the other people and rent each room independently and, on the other hand, you have the guarantee to receive all 3500eur each month. In order to get both these priorities, I thought about having first one contract with me and you which asks me to pay the whole 3500€ rent to you each month, together with the first deposit. Then there would be other contracts between the other tenants and you which ask them _to repay me_ the respective part of the rent. In this way my personal rent would be the difference in cashflow on my bank account between the 3500€ I would pay monthly to you and the rent of the other tenants; I would therefore also be responsible if during some months there will be less than the full number of tenants, this would automatically result in an increase of my rent. All of this would not require a registration (not even for me), since all contracts are signed between you and the tenants, nor any allowance to sublet; in this way you would also have full control of the house since each contract can only be signed by you.
Feel free to tell me when you prefer to make a call to discuss the terms or ask for clarifications, or answer me via message. Once terms are agreed and contract signed, I am ready to pay for the deposit in the next week. Have a nice weekend! 
Simone
#### 24.05.2024, Online Call, 16:10
As planned during the call I sent her the message below. In the call we basically decided nothing, since she has to talk all these things through with her partner. The following is a message I will send her as a summary of all things left to clarify, I will send it to her in this evening:

Here is a recap of the questions that came up during the last meeting:
_Registration_: I recently contacted the other students and know for sure that they don't need registration. Though I will need it and can offer the following in exchange of it: (i) a surplus on the monthly rent (that is in case there were more taxes on a monthly bases that you need to pay) or, preferably, (ii) a one-time payment (that is if there is bureaucracy that requires working time). Since I can't have a grasp of how much work or increase in taxation one further registration added to the house may imply, I suppose that it is best for you to make the offer and I will discuss it with the other potential tenants. If this is done in accordance with what is requested below, we may afford an higher price.

_Sublet_: the allowance to sublet would make things way easier from an administrative point of view, it would prevent us from changing the contract whenever one of the three (maximally four) tenants changes and allow us a more flexible approach for making a fourth tenant fit into the house, i.e. without the need to have a fixed fourth bedroom. That is, for example, to rent a room during the summer while we can enjoy the terrace but have the living room free during the winter. Among the potential tenants, I am the one that is most likely to stay in Amsterdam and in the house for the longest and, thanks to the registration and a note in the contract, I would be able to handle this independently. Independence does not imply that you will in any way lose control over the house, here are some measures we discussed in the call of how such control can be maintained, feel free to chose those that fit you best:
- You will be given notice in advance on any short (no matter how short) and long term stay with ID and description of the person renting, you will always have the right to deny allowance or ask for more information for any person without the need of any justification.
- In order for you to have a better assurance, there can be a separate short term contract for my rent of the house so that if anything goes wrong during this sort of "trial-period" you are free to revoke the right of sublet and the registration without the need to give any justification by simply not renewing the same contract.
- In order to build trust, at the beginning of my rent there can be special limitations regarding the sublet, e.g. maximal/minimal duration of the stay, maximally three people instead of four or any other limitation that can make you feel more comfortable.
- Measures to make you sure of the physical integrity of the house can also be planned, if that is a worry. In this respect, I am also open to offer an higher deposit.
Each of these points can be stated in the contract together with any other limitation you suggest. Any sublet would be done in accordance with the City of Amsterdam. Take your time to let me know what your thoughts are,
Best wishes,
Simone
#### 23.05.24, Meeting with the House Master
The house master claimed that:
- No sublet of any sort is possible
- No registration for anyone and by [[Airbnb in Amsterdam.fi#Legal Constrains]] I will need it.

I can find a solution by calling them on meet I want to get to:
- One registration for me only and other people will live with contract and no registration.
- I can sublet by contract, house master does not need to know.

I will send two messages, one to ask for the online meeting and a second one for the sources to my argument:

"Good afternoon, I am Simone the potential tenant of your house, I just talked with Silvia and my friend about the meeting with the house master. It would be best if we could make another video call and see how to proceed. I am available today, tomorrow from 12 and all day in the weekend. Thank you and have nice day, Simone"

The message with sources follows:
- "Registration is mandatory when you are staying more than 4 months in The Netherlands.." (https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/working-at-the-uva/practical-information/housing/registration-city-taxes-and-allowances/registration-city-taxes-and-allowances.html, see also: https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/registration-with-the-municipality). Therefore basically, as far as I understand, every potential long-term tenant will need registration.
- There are limits in the amount of people living in the apartment but they aren't the same for the registration: (https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/civil-affairs/applying-postal-address), there is _no need to move your registration_, if this is the worry.
- The only exception: "If you have no fixed residential address in the Netherlands, you can register temporarily at the address of someone you know." (link above), I have found one girl (and potentially a second) that might not need registration (i.e. not student, not working and with Dutch citizenship and family). Can the reason why a _single student registration_ be solved financially? That is by a surplus on the rent?
- Therefore only one _student registration_ to the municipality is needed, the one for me so that the other girl(s) can rent the other room(s). That is, once the (any kind of) contact is signed, I only need to show it to the office together with my personal documents, and it all will be done (https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/civil-affairs/first-registration).
- As mentioned in the previous call, allowance of sublet helps us to split the prices in a more dynamic way (so that the contract with you does not need to change), if there is any problem with that, it is fine to have that allowance for short-term stays only.
