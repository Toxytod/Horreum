## Legal Constrains
First of all (given the pricy [fines](https://www.amsterdam.nl/wonen-leefomgeving/wonen/boetes-overtredingen-vakantieverhuur-bed/)), here is a list of the [laws](https://www.amsterdam.nl/wonen-leefomgeving/wonen/bedandbreakfast/regels/) on B&B (the source has been automatically translated by Safari) in Amsterdam and below each one, how I proceed to make sure I respect it. I didn't paste some that are either obvious or do not apply to my case:
1. "You have stayed at the address of your B&B for at least 6 months for the past 12 months." & "You are registered with the municipality of Amsterdam at the address of the B&B."
	- I will be registered from August 2024 and plan to start the activity not before February 2025
2. "You use a maximum of 40 percent of the total usable area of the house or houseboat for your B&B", in particular "Spaces shared by the guests and the main resident count for 50 percent." & "You can rent a maximum of 61 square meters. As a measurement method"
	- Based on [[Layout_Sizes.pdf]] (which will be more accurate once I can measure the house), I computed all combinations of rooms that I can rent respecting these rules: [Airbnb Sizes Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10w2act__-_cBkqODUviCBpnBRVLdLBSTUeqhRxY__0Y/edit).
3. "You must have fixed bedrooms for the guests."
	- Each rented room will either be a bedroom or the living room will be turned permanently into a bedroom. I plan to minimise the overall vacancy rate, there are no breaks planned in which I might change rooms.
4. "this room should not be an independent living space with its own entrance, kitchen, toilet and bathroom."
	- It will not be, kitchen and bathrooms are shared.
5. "You have up to 4 sleeps for 4 guests. Offering breakfast is not mandatory"
	- Even in the most optimistic reported in [Airbnb Sizes Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10w2act__-_cBkqODUviCBpnBRVLdLBSTUeqhRxY__0Y/edit), I plan to have two single bedrooms and one double bedroom. The singles might, by having a large bed, might be used as doubles from time to time, I will pay attention not to have more than 4 guests at the same time.
6. "If you have guests, you will be present at night in the property or houseboat."
7. "You must keep a night register."
	- More than the required data will be kept in a (possibly) public register.
8. "Often you also need permission from the owners' association, the bank or the insurer"
	- The landlord would know and agree with all details of the plan. She, if requested, will be updated on all news.
9. "You will have to pay tourist tax and income tax."
	- All I need to know about taxes is exposed in [[Taxes in the Netherlands.fi]].
#### Questions
Despite the clarity of most rules in the website there are some that are still unclear, here I paste the email that I send to get more of a concrete grasp on these points.

Good morning,

I am an Italian student and will move to Amsterdam from August. In agreement with my future landlord, I was thinking about organising an Airbnb in one or two of the free rooms of the apartment I will rent. I found the page on the website (https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/housing/new-bed-breakfast-policy/) to be very clear apart from some points that I wanted to get a better grasp on and which I list here. Feel free to answer me via email (simone.testion@gmail.com), to give me a call (+39 339 637 9379) or also have an online meeting on Zoom or Google Meet.

1. The first questions are on taxation: I am aware that there are basically two taxes that I need to pay, the income tax (regulated by the standard Box 1 taxes for self employment) and the tourist tax. So, to make an example, as far as I understand, if I get 4000€ profit in one month I will need to first subtract the expenses (say 2000€ of rent + 200€ of breakfast and other related expenses), then on the remaining 1800€ I will need first to pay the income tax (about 10%) and then the tourist tax of 12.5%. So here are my questions:
	1. Are these calculations correct? Is it right that I need first to pay the income tax and then the tourist tax?
	2. Is there some other tax (e.g. VAT) that I need to pay?
	3. Is there no way of letting this count as a passive investment other than an active job (perhaps by not offering breakfast or having a third person worrying about the customers) and then let it count in Box 3?
		1. How can I register my Airbnb as a Business so that I can have the SME profit exemption? (on this regard I read https://www.poundwise.nl/income-from-bed-breakfast/?lang=en)
	4. Is it correct that I can first subtract all expenses and then pay the taxes on the gross income other than on the total profit?
2. The address of the house I will rent is: Van Hallsstraat 294 Amsterdam 1051 HM can you check whether I will be able to get a registration as an B&B for the municipality?
	1. When registering will I only need to have with me my ID and my documents of registration to that address? Is there something else needed? Should also the other people registered to the house (potentially the landlord) be present when I get the registration of the Municipality or is it enough if I am there (and registered to that address)?
Thank you and best regards,
Simone Testino
