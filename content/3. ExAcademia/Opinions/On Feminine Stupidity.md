###### Apology to the Title
Even in [Weininger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Weininger)'s time such a title would have required an apology. The precise declination of _Feminine_ shall certainly be clarified. It refers strictly to the nowadays archaic (is it?) conception of the female gender[^1] that rejects rational thinking and technical knowledge through the excessive and immoderate influence of affections and fleeting emotions (as [[Books Index#Dante]]'s Convivio presents but present also in [Geschlecht und Charakter](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sex_and_Character) by the already named [O. Weininger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Weininger) and, in a less obvious way, in [[Books Index#Pirandello]]). That is to say that the provocative title does not denote either the female sex or the female gender as I personally see it.
###### Mansplaining and the Archaic Woman
The term [_mansplaining_](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/mansplaining), together with young mildly conservative movements attempting to restore and redefine a socially univocal conception of feminine gender (perhaps as in [Brett Cooper](https://youtube.com/@thecommentssection?si=fpm7mrviWwV0_CaD)), show critically or compassionately how the Archaic Female Gender still plays a role in modern society. The use of the term _mansplaining_, while, as presented in its definition, is supposed to criticise a _useless_ explanation of a technical mechanism or a rational thought by a man to a woman, it is often also used when for any sort of accidental reasons, the woman actually proves herself in ignorance in that field or shows and admits misunderstanding of the relative train of thoughts. This turns a term supposed to let the modern female gender take distances from the archaic one to the opposite meaning, giving a name and remarking each time when a woman finds herself to play the archaic role, letting then the archaic gender take a breath again.
###### On my Feminine Gender[^1]
When it comes to the necessary personal act of creating a feminine gender, happening tacitly or as a result of self-reflection and ponder, the phenomena described above make it hard to balance the archaic and the modern feminine worlds. While I personally grew up surrounded by authors presenting an archaic role[^2] and women for most part playing it, I feel like I never had even a glimpse of any modern alternative. The more distance I attempt to take from the archaic gender, the more I cannot but see myself surrounded by archaic women that make the modern one be but an exemption to the still vivid good old gender.
###### Again on the Feminine Archaic Gender
The most evident trait of the archaic woman is the relationship with rational thinking and technical knowledge pictured above, which is connected to the excessive influence of changing emotions in most decisive processes. This shapes archaic women in two ways: on one hand it corrupts her ability to self-determination, letting her way of conducting life be floating in fleeting emotions and on the other hand they put the urge in the archaic woman to find stability in others' strengths.

_Virtus_ of the archaic woman is empathy and agreeableness, hurriedly skipping an analysis of herself as an individual. This combined with the modern barren hopes and lacking passions[^3] leaves the archaic woman desolated without the bravery of a glimpse in the future.

In society and liberal markets such poor rationality and confidence, unfamiliarity with technique and excessive agreeableness cannot but result in scarse salary and personal growth. The importance of this gender in society and its correspondence with feminine sex cannot but increase due to weak social recognition; furthermore attempts to its eradication is often claimed pointless due to natural connection to the feminine sex (see [[Freedom vs Sex Sameness]]).

[^1]: I use gender as more precisely described by J. Butler in [Presentation of Gender Theory](https://youtu.be/UD9IOllUR4k?si=kEzLigOqS2I4LTvo).
[^2]: In [[Books Index#Dante]]e feminine gender deserves a far more complex analysis, the description given above covers only partially the feminine gender and only in technical environments like in the Convivio, crucially different, though not incoherent, with the one presented in Vita Nova.
[^3]: See "L'Ospite Inquietante" by [[Books Index#Galimberti]] also [Il Grido](https://youtu.be/M9zdwrVzjfA?si=4iUzviI6bTAO51Z3) by [[Books Index#Gaber]]both in Italian).

Both underlying how women that found themselves in the archaic gender could, in an impressive short term, modernise themselves by making important decisions and taking responsibilities.
