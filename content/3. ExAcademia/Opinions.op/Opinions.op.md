In this collection of notes, I write down several thoughts I have had of different sort, most will concern politics or field in applied philosophy that I don't recognise as being in any way part of my studies in Philosophy, since my focus is shifted towards very theoretical analytical philosophy ([[Curriculum_Vitae.pdf]]).

What is crucial to understand the core of some of the writings I will upload in this section, is the fact that I consider these as opinions whose assumption I try to declare at best of my of my capabilities. Those assumptions though, shall be analysed, I claim, in dependence of nothing other than anyone's personal taste, and, since my personal taste is of nobody's particular interest, I will often not explicitly declare my personal position. This approach follows from the way I see [[Ethics as Aesthetics]].

Like any other ex-academic document on this website (like [[Carmina.pi]]), I pick an ending for each page or folder of this category, `.op` for those in this collection. As for any other page, the reader is encouraged to leave [[Comments]].
