#### High Dosage Caffeine Trial
I tracked the effects of varying doses of a caffeine booster over several days, noting symptoms like dizziness, abdominal discomfort, and difficulties with coordination. The caffeine intake resulted in diuretic and laxative effects, likely due to the large amounts of cold water consumed with each dose, along with reduced appetite and libido. Notably, intake following periods of no consumption led to significant improvements in study performance. Based on these trials, I decided to purchase [Caffeine Tablets](https://www.amazon.de/Koffeintabletten-365x-laborgepr%C3%BCft-Koffein-Gehalt-unerw%C3%BCnschte/dp/B0CKY62W8L/ref=sr_1_7?crid=208PANQN05WC1&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7W6hzJYHDp5WRkYNreMS9bmD4dsT3qg9zEcq2sXtNCmex7g3700L8uX5teRpSqmNIre_HaQdTkfcp3Vt3xgK0qHYgJor-giVfdVwdM8HRmpH_32vVNfbQTEF2YRdwL9fUxgjBICj3KvnwEVHcWsQtqdq5Zt_tbYq-G15MDWOacrfAD8mbSEJRHzCh7UIVL0B0DiJLYiuWe7fhtUdnixwSTFIiPeDUpnpNLGuOgFhYFCmd-e_OWcKBdOKNhy5xJhUb26Pr1JHIKuT-ampLaQ5ets19DNndDInb9BZ5GouTdg.hoJBNQITcl2UQRqxjss_dX6f5veszHQ2NPlHPFiAHeQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=koffeintabletten&qid=1720510550&sprefix=koffein%2Caps%2C101&sr=8-7&th=1) for consistent dosage at a lower cost.

For maximal dosage and other data I used [https://www.drugscience.org.uk/caffeine](https://www.drugscience.org.uk/caffeine), measures (like not a sporadic use) will be taken to avoid dependency.
