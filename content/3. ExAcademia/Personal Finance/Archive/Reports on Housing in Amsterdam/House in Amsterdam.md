On this page and the later listed below are some files and data regarding when I first began looking into a house in Amsterdam and looked for ways to even make moneys out of it. These notes are currently not in use nor updated, but they may be used again in the future, perhaps in substitution to the more recent [[Sublet Homepage]].

The pages that may turn out to be most useful in the future for financial planning and making up activities, are these two:
- [[Fictional Sublet]]
- [[Airbnb in Amsterdam]]

Other less relevant pages are:
- [[Living in Amsterdam]]
- [[Housing Record]]
- The following details on this page.

In this page you can find all details currently available on the house I will rent in Amsterdam together with other students.
#### 🏠 **House Details**:
- Indoor + terrace: $90m^2 + 20m^2$, 
-  3 bedrooms, living room (potential bedroom), dining room (my future bedroom), kitchen and bathroom.

#### 📋 House Rules
- The Landlord has been very clear that no parties, smoking or pets are allowed in the house.

 Costs will depend on many variables, maximal number of allowed tenants, size of the room and length of stay. Therefore all of this shall be decided on a personal basis. Details of how on the contract will also be decided by the landlord and will be communicated in a personal base.
