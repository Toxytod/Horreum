This page provides all the necessary information regarding the payment options for your stay. Below you find details on rates for single and double guests, as well as special rates for specific periods. Payment options are listed at the end.
## ðŸ’° Deposit
A â‚¬200 deposit is required, it can be paid upon arrival once you are sure that the room satisfies your expectations. I have chosen â‚¬200 as it is the maximum value of any single item present in the room. The deposit will be refunded at the end of your stay, provided no damage is done to the room.
