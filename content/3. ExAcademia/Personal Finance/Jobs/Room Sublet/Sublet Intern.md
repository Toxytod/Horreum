Here I collect the financial consequences of my sporadic sublet in Amsterdam [[Sublet Homepage]]. This is a smaller versions of bigger projects like [[Airbnb in Amsterdam]] which may be realisable in the future.

Here is a [Sublet Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C0rmivuTvYTrSj69uN1UJMt1Rh8IycghYy49doeUWGM/edit?usp=sharing) with all financial details on the matter, there I list each one of the planned, actual and potential customers with all details on them. There I use the following notation that might not be clear: `n` stands for _number of nights_, `p` stands for _number of people_ and `d` for the day written as a date; I write `bool` when the answer can only be `1` or `0`, i.e. _yes_ or _no_.
