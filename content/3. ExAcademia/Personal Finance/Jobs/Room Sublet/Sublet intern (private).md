Here I collect the financial consequences of my sporadic sublet in Amsterdam [[Sublet Homepage]]. This is a smaller versions of bigger projects like [[Airbnb in Amsterdam]] which may be realisable in the future.

Here is a [Sublet Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C0rmivuTvYTrSj69uN1UJMt1Rh8IycghYy49doeUWGM/edit?usp=sharing) with all financial details on the matter, there I list each one of the planned, actual and potential customers with all details on them. There I use the following notation that might not be clear: `n` stands for _number of nights_, `p` stands for _number of people_ and `d` for the day written as a date; I write `bool` when the answer can only be `1` or `0`, i.e. _yes_ or _no_. I will soon replace the table with [[Sublet (SIP.py)]].
#### Risk Balance
Being aware that sublet is not permitted in my dorm, I collect here the relevant passages from the contact:
	 it is forbidden to sublet the rented property, in part or in full (including holiday rentals via, for example, Airbnb and couch surfing). In the event of a violation of this prohibition, the tenant will forfeit to the landlord an immediately due and payable fine of € 100 per day with a maximum of € 10,000, without prejudice to the landlord's right to full compensation.

Taking this into account, and considering that I am averaging above 50€ per night, it would still make sense not to limit the amount of people I allow in the room (as long as the probability of getting caught and fined can be estimated as sensibly below 50%). On top of that I cannot rally picture how the corporate would prove me to be subletting other than thanks to a confession form the customers (or mine, which is also not to exclude if the risks of lying is more severe). As long as the flatmates seem agreeable on the matter I see no particular reason to worry (even though on 22nd Sep. some suspects have been detected).
