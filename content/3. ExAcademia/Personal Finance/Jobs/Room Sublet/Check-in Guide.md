### Before Arriving at the Room
Please ensure you've completed every item on this **Checklist**:
1. You're either sure I'll be there when you arrive, or you've already paid both the deposit and the full amount for your stay.
2. To get your Digital Key, follow these steps:
   1. Send me your email (see [[Contacts]]).
   2. Download the "Lieven de Key" app.
   3. You'll receive a code and an email from the dorm. Follow the instructions in the app to activate your key. When prompted to choose a building, select "Plantage Muidergracht 20 & 125."
   4. Once your key is active, it should look like this: [[Digital_Key.png]].

### How to Get to the Room
Here's a [video](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-7f7a5VgVAEEpvizZq2wrDy3f_JXPfSS) with directions to the room. Please also note the following:
- You'll need your Digital Key to open the first door. If it's not working and you've already paid the deposit, I can give you my personal code. Just contact me: [[Contacts]].
- After entering the first door, there’s a second one directly ahead, which is usually unlocked. If it’s locked, repeat the process using the lock to the left of the door.
- Once you're through the second door, turn right and head up the stairs. I live on the second floor—after the stone stairs, continue up the wooden ones to the next floor.
- You'll see rooms labelled F1 - F6. You’ll need your Digital Key again to pass through the red door. If you’ve arranged check-in with me in advance and completed payment, I might leave the door unlocked. Otherwise, use the key on your phone. If you encounter any issues, follow the app’s instructions and contact me.
- Inside the apartment, head to the **very last door** marked F6.

Once you are close to the building, you can use the Wifi: `Ziggo_itdesk`, Password: `dekey2017`.
#### House Rules
To ensure a pleasant stay and avoid deductions from your deposit, please follow these rules:

- Keep noise to a minimum late at night and early in the morning.
- No guests are allowed in the building unless previously agreed upon. Violating this may result in significant fines.
- For privacy reasons, I’d prefer my flatmates not to know I’m subletting, so please say we are friends (I will provide details) and avoid mentioning any payments. Breaching this rule can also lead to fines.
- Feel free to use the kitchen, but please keep it clean. The bathroom next to my door is available for you as well. It is not allowed to use the bathrooms of the other rooms, this also leads to fines.
- If you plan to return late at night, no problem—just let me know in advance.
