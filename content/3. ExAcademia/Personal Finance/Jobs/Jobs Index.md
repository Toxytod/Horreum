I present here the various jobs, or, more generally, sources of income, that I have been working on in the recent times. I divide the list for the academic years.

#### 2023/4
The main source of income, as presented in [[Finance Homepage]], are my parents. I have been working on how to best handle my [[Finance Homepage#Capital & Allocation]]. I did no further work or had other significant sources of income.
#### 2024/5
Keeping my parents as my first source of income, as presented in [[Finance Homepage]] and keeping track of my investments (see [[Finance Homepage#Transactions `Trans`]]), I worked on the following projects:
