In my [Financial Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17oMLO9vAbR9Kw82BlghC2f68sUaXR09EbZ48AdeFibo/edit?usp=sharing) I keep record of my savings month by month starting from June 2024, i.e. two months before moving to Amsterdam and beginning my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]]. Other than keeping track of savings I do also sketch [[Finance Homepage#Projections]] and [[Finance Homepage#Cash Flow]]. In this page I both explain the data present in the [Financial Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17oMLO9vAbR9Kw82BlghC2f68sUaXR09EbZ48AdeFibo/edit?usp=sharing) and add some further textual information to it; usually the update of this page is less frequent than the one of the spreadsheet.

Other than this page, there are some other files in this folder on my financial situation, here I list them:
- Sources of Income
	- [[Futura]]
	- [[Sublet Homepage]]
	- [[Netflix Sharing]]
- [[Taxes in the Netherlands]]
## Capital & Allocation
One of the primary uses of the [Financial Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17oMLO9vAbR9Kw82BlghC2f68sUaXR09EbZ48AdeFibo/edit?usp=sharing) is to monitor my total net worth, i.e. the sum of all my possessions. Because of negligible amount and since they will not be liquid in the future, I decided not to take into account the objects I posses; I might make exceptions to these rules in case I will posses objects of considerable value or that I plan to resell.
### Actual Statistics `Act_Stats` & Actual Data `Act_Data`
In `Act_Data` every first day of the month the asset allocation of all my net worth. I divide it depending on the bank or location in which those money are stored. Since I record those data on the first day of the month (in order to avoid any cherry-picking phenomenon), I added the `Short-Term Liquidity` where I collect the liquidity that is present in the investment account that is not representative of the month. The month after will then show where such liquidity has been allocated.

On `Act_Stats` I show some statistics on the data collected in `Act_Data`, there  I simply present the _asset allocation_ of my net worth. I divide it in different core areas and present both the differences with a $\Delta$ and the ratios with `rat`. Other than that, I present the variations of my capital during the months and year-to-date (which refers to the beginning off my tracking, i.e. the beginning of the academic year on which the spreadsheet is based).
### Transactions `Trans`
On this sheet I record all transactions, every change in asset allocation and movements between bank accounts is recorded here. I do not list those regular transactions, i.e. those listed in [[Finance Homepage#Cash Flow `Reg_ME` & `Reg_MI`]]. In the rest of this page I comment some of the decisions I made and the reasons that took me to change my asset allocation.
#### 06.2024
I consider valuations of the US too high, and partially this applies to the EU market too. Because of this I decided to go for different assets class like US treasury bonds and equities in the emerging markets. Pessimistic news regarding the job market may bring small-cap American companies get to an interesting valuations, therefore I am considering to buy the Russell 2000. On the other hand the high bond rates o

**DTLE** in the expectation that interest rates will decrease I bought this ETF replicating the TLT about six months ago. Currently I am still holding, most probably at least until the end of the month. On the 15.06 there will be half of the yearly dividends, i.e. 2.02%.

**China** from some months I have BABA and JD in my portfolio since they are commonly considered to be undervalued and will hopefully go better with the increase of the Chinese demand.
#### 08.2024
**DTLE** I decided to close this position due to the apparent strength of the American Real Economy and the already accounted _soft-landing_ scenario. 

**BIDU** Having a large amount of liquidity and being willing to increase my exposition to the Chinese economy, I decided to buy Baidu at the surprisingly low valuations.

#### 09.2024
I didn't do any big change in the asset allocation. I am planning to invest the current liquidity, still maintaining the hope in the Chinese market, despite the absence of good news and losing confidence in CSIQ, which reached another low, making up to -55% from the current average entry price.

I finally chose to sell JD (the day before it did 7% -\_-) and decided to keep BABA and BIDU as the only two single Chinese stocks. 

## Cash Flow
### `Reg_ME` & `Reg_MI`
Another crucial function of the [Financial Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17oMLO9vAbR9Kw82BlghC2f68sUaXR09EbZ48AdeFibo/edit?usp=sharing) is to make [[Finance Homepage#Projections]] of the capital in both the short and long term; in order to allow that, it is essential to first keep record of the regular monthly expenses and income.
### Work Futura `Work_Futura`
In this sheet I record data on my work as an employee in [Futura.study](http://www.futura.study/), which I also expose in [[Futura]], these data have intersections with [[Finance Homepage#Cash Flow `Reg_ME` & `Reg_MI`]]
## Projections
I distinguish those projections of my capital that are in the short term from those that are in the long term and explain the different assumptions behind both analyses.
### Short Time Projections `Proj_ST`
In the short terms projections, I try to be very realistic and list all expenses I can foresee. On top of that I also try to make predictions about the total amount of money I will be able to save. I collect data basing on an academic yearly basis, this is the case since often, the end of the academic year comported a series of financial changes in my daily life and is therefore more practical, this might change in the future.
### Long Time Projections `Proj_LT`
In this sheet I present different scenarios and here I expose the underlying assumptions. The simplest one of all is the I. Scenario in which I assume 7% annual gains (net to inflation) and a 500€/month savings. I also consider a second scenario in which the monthly saved amount increases by a constant each year.
##### Accounting of Economic and Life Inflation
In the [Savings Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TZTK3joKoFsIVu_OHEVGfTO1_Z6Mg3q_Y0bQBc0Vblc/edit?usp=sharing) each currency can appear in three different forms: the simplest one is its _pure value_, written by its usual symbol of the currency, e.g. "€", and denotes the amount of money in that currency as classically meant, i.e. at the value of that currency at that time in history.

With "€r" I denote the _real value_, that is the value of that currency at its present purchase power, i.e. each development in time of amounts signed with "€r" is diminished according to inflation predictions (to be found under the "Data" sheet).

Finally with "€l" I denote the _real life value_, that is the one that is not only subject to inflation, as in "€r" but also to the so called _Life Inflation_. That is the percentage by which I predict my yearly expenses to increase in order to keep an analogous lifestyle in the years to come.

For the economic inflation rate I chose by default a 2% (though recent discussion on the natural central bank rates may suggest 2.5% to be more appropriate). On the other hand the life inflation is far harder to estimate since it clearly depends on many factors, it is most probably far from linear and drastically depends on the financial status of the partner. In most cases $\forall_{x, y, z \in \mathbb{Q}} x$ €$= y$ €r $= z$ $€$ l $\to x > y > z$.
