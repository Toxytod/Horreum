In this page you can find both external links, like [Google](https://www.google.com), or internal links, like [[Index of Bachelor Works]], explore those pages by clicking on the links. On the right you can find the table of contents and on the left you can explore all folders uploaded on the website. In this website I mainly upload my little academic work where most can currently be found at [[Index of Bachelor Works]] and in [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]], for a shorter view see [[Curriculum_Vitae.pdf]].

The reader can leave [[Comments]] and is given my [[Contacts]], I am happy to discuss and review any content on this website. Here you can also find pages on different topics that have little or nothing to do with my academic life, those are collected in [[ExAcademia Index]]. The rest of this page is dedicated to a brief overview on my life up to today.
### School Years
I was born in [Genoa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SQ3dbn5pLBdD5xYKA) and spent there all my childhood up to my first year of high school (14 years old). Then I moved to [Baden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LMU7ArNQwwto4PU48?g_st=ic), Switzerland with my father, and went to [Liceo Vermigli](http://liceo-vermigli.com/), an Italian private school in Zurich. Aspiring for better integration and competitiveness, I preferred to attend the Swiss Cantonal School, and, in order to get there, I improved my German from A1 to B2.

The two years after I have been a student at the [Swiss Cantonal School in Baden](https://www.kanti-baden.ch/). By the half of the second year, I began to feel uncomfortable there too, my desire to study humanities more rigorously grew, and because of both unavoidable linguistic issues and the technical essence of the Swiss School, I considered moving back to Italy.

Once I arrived back to Genoa, my aim was to get in the [Liceo Classico A. D'Oria](https://liceodoria.edu.it/) where I could have satisfied all my humanistic desires, though, since there were too many subjects I din't have in the Swiss school, I spent the first year in Genoa at [Liceo Scientifico Cassini](https://www.liceocassini.it/), a scientific school with Latin but no Greek. In order to get there I passed an exam on all six different subjects that I didn't have in Switzerland.

After studying ancient Greek in the summer, I finally got into the Liceo Classico where I spent my fifth and last year of high school studies, I passed the final exam with 96/100 [[High School Diploma.pdf]].
### Early University Years
I spent my first year of university at the [University of Constance](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/) officially registered in the B.A. Philosophy but practically following all courses of the B.Sc. in Mathematics too. The professors I got closest too are: [[Leon Horsten]] and [Sam Roberts](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/en/ag-leon-horsten/members-of-the-ag-horsten/academic-staff/sam-roberts/) in analytical philosophy and [Mateusz Micha≈Çek](https://www.mathematik.uni-konstanz.de/working-group-real-geometry-and-algebra/prof-dr-mateusz-michalek/) in Algebra. Even though I originally planned to go to the LMU Munich, for its academic excellence in Analytic Philosophy, I had bureaucratic issues with the application and was therefore forced to seek alternatives. I consider myself to have been very lucky to get into the University of Constance with a Philosophy department amazingly focussed on my interests.

Despite finding myself well in Constance, after the first year I decided to get back to the original plan and move to the LMU Munich where I continued both the [[B.A. Philosophy (LMU)]] and the [[B.Sc. Mathematics (LMU)]]. There I mostly enjoyed the [MCMP](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) where I followed different lectures, in particular I got closer to [John Dougherty](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/dougherty_john/index.html), supervisor of my [[B.A. Philosophy Thesis]], and [Alessandra Marra](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/marra_alessandra/index.html).

In August 2024 I plan to finish the [[B.A. Philosophy (LMU)]] before I move to Amsterdam to begin my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]]; I will also get back to Munich to give the last exams missing to conclude my [[B.Sc. Mathematics (LMU)]].
