This website is structured so that you can navigate between pages using internal links, such as [[Horreum]]. Some other links are external and take you to other web pages, like [Google](https://www.google.com). On this homepage, I present the general structure of the website and highlight the most relevant pages you may want to visit.

**Structure of the Website**
1. _[[Active & Works]]_: where I collect my academic texts, lecture notes, and essays.
2. _[[Passive & Notes]]_: here you will find my notes on papers and authors.
3. _[[ExAcademia]]_: notes on any other productive aspect of my life outside academia can be found here.
4. _System_: In this last folder, I collect files that enable the [[index#Website Functions]].

### Main Content
The most relevant pages for my academic work are [[Index of Bachelor Works]] and [[Index of Master Works]]. Here, all my thoughts and projects during my academic journey are organised and listed. Among these, you can find my [[Bachelor Thesis]] and my research project [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)]]. Papers I plan on reading soon are available at [[Papers to Read]], and [[Passive & Notes]] gives a general outline of the literature I am familiar with.

Outside of academia, I also publish details about my financial life in [[Finance Homepage]], and I share some of the Python programs Iâ€™ve written to organise larger amounts of data in [[Storage Information Programs with OOP]]. Finally, a [[Condensed Bio]] is available to give you an idea of my background and the significant life choices I've made. I have also uploaded my [[Business Curriculum.pdf]].
##### Website Functions
You are always welcome to leave [[Comments]] on this website. You can also find a general list of [[Documents]] that I have made public, which certify most of the data I publish.
