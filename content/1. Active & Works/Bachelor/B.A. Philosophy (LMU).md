I started my Philosophy Bachelor in the University of Constance in October 2022 with a minor in Mathematics, I then moved to the LMU Munich in October 2023 and completed the bachelor on the 1st August 2024. I studied this bachelor along with the [[B.Sc. Mathematics (LMU)]]. I continue my studies in the same field with the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]].

The list of the essays I submitted for the different courses can be found at [[Index of Bachelor Works]] at [[Index of Bachelor Works#Philosophy]], in particular see the [[Bachelor Thesis]]. Details on the ECTS and timing can be found under [[Bachelors Outline]] and all documents regarding it can be dowloaded from [[Documents]] at [[Documents#Ludwig Maximilian Universität München]].
