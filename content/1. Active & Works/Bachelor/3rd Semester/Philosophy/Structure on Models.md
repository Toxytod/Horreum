~~This~~ page contains the essay for the course in Category Theory by [J. Dougherty](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/dougherty_john/index.html). The current form of the essay is available on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bpgzrdxchmyp#101b9c). The essay is founded on the discussion by [[Hans Halvorson]] exposed in [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]]. I then reformulate in a more precise language the directions I designed in the comment to the paper.

Here is the certificate and mark which is necessary since it does not count in my [[B.A. Philosophy (LMU)]]: [[Schein_Cat.Th._LMU.pdf]]
