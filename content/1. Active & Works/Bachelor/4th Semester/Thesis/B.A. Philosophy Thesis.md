##### Disputation Notes
- I begin with presenting the **motivation** & **achievements**:
	1. Take **definitions** resent in the **literature** and present
	2. them in one unique _fully formalised_ work.
		- I made some philosophical **choices** to keep things **formal** & **simple**
			1. have a **syntactic** approach and leave out some aspects of languages
				- highlighted: Definitions as Complete Descriptions, the Morphisms of Languages
					- new: Logical Universe, new unders.: Atomic Formulae, also: Translations.
				- left out: Distinction of Free/Bounded Variables, Semantics, Models of a Theory
	3. I sketched proof methods and gave **practical examples**:
		- How to **construct** a Translation
			- through **encoding** (relational and set-theoretic)
		- How to prove that there is **no Translation** between Logics
			- through **comparison of Logical Universes**
		- Also: that gave an idea of **questions that can be answered** with Language Theory

### Comment by Prof. Leitgeb & Email
After presenting my project to the Mathematical Philosophy Colloquium at the [[LMU Munich]], Prof. Leitgeb made some remarks on the the thesis. The most relevant ones concerning the conceptual aspect of the thesis were those criticising the lack of contact with the present literature. Other than underlying how this is the case for my definition of Complete Description, he argued in a later email that the same critique can be easily made to other core aspects of my project too.

_\two additional points that I did not have time to make:_
- _When you were dealing with translations, I think you dealt with a slightly restricted version of that is known as "relative interpretation of one theory into another“ in the logic literature. My recommendation would be to check out the notion, see what people have done with it, and mention all of that in the thesis._
- _About logicism: it seems what you showed was that ZFC is not relatively interpretable into first-order logic. But of course this is very well-known, and I do not know any logicist who would have ever claimed otherwise. (That is why logicists invoke stronger resources than just first-order logic, such as higher-order logic, type theory, object theory, etc.) So I would certainly not present this as an attempt at refuting logicism as it is traditionally understood in the standard literature._

I proceeded then for my [[B.Sc. Mathematics Thesis]] to list some papers in particular on the notion of _"relative interpretation of one theory into another“_ (listed in [[Papers to Read#Papers to Read in Interpretability Theory]]]).
