There are two main assumptions that are required for my argument, here I give a more precise statement of both and present the content that will be part of the thesis.
## Structuralism
I follow from the Tarskian definition of truth the necessity of considering possible worlds as mathematical models. This argument will be expanded in [[Structuralism]], this page contains the references to the essay(s) in Philosophy of Logic regarding the same theme but also further considerations that will be part of the thesis only. In [[Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation]] I expended the discourse in relation to the debate on fixing reference, the model theoretic argument and the interpretation of our language. I also uploaded a list of references I will consult when writing this section of the thesis.
#### Abstract
The Tarskian definition of logical consequence requires us to consider models within the same formal system of any proposition that we want to prove true. I then expose how the Tarskian Truth definition applied to any sort of empirical sentence requires an analysis of the formal system of possible worlds, considered as structures. I proceed by analysing the form of structuralism required for the theory to work and its implications.

### Modal Realism
For this section I will mainly refer to [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/david-lewis/#6) section 6, I plan to only expose the Lewis' argument and show compatibility with Structuralism. I plan to start working on this section later on.

### On Ultraproducts
This section will be dedicated to why I believe that ultraproducts of possible worlds must be considered possible worlds as well. I will then analyse the single ultraproducts constructed in [[Mathematics First Thesis Concept]] and show what philosophical consequence they imply. I will work on this last part of the philosophy thesis as soon as I have some results in the mathematics thesis, this will be therefore the very last part I will begin.
