In this course I present my [[B.A. Philosophy Thesis]] and submit a protocol on the persentation of two other students. This corresponds to the module P10 in the [[B.A. Philosophy (LMU)]], the certificate can be found in the [[Documents]] under [[Documents#Ludwig Maximilian Universität München]].

Example of semantic approach, we have a structure that captures a system for classical particle mechanics. which has five componentds describing the set of particles, the real numbers of the time, the mass of each particle, the position in time and the force in time. For the semantic view the theory is the set of models, that is everything that the theory is.

These intuitions led to different froms of scientific structuralims. there is epistemic structural realism, ontic structural realism and finally structural empiricism (by Van fraassen). 

But why structuralism? In particular the presenter presents the no miracle argument, similarly to how it is presented in the resepctive SEP entry.

More broadly, the presenter presents the russelss analysis on matter, how matter interacts with people, perception in a causal way. a relation number is the class of all relations similar to a gien relation, it is an equivalence class. To take objects as sets of relations over a domain, ralational structures. Pur knowledge of an electrico comes down to an inference of a strucutred set of precpects. The russelian thesis is though a weak one, a stronger notion saus that all the knowledge we can have on the world is structural.

Similarly the same is done by Carnap, one begins with the simpler objects and then they are made more complicated. From these tools carnap contrsucts properties and class of propertes.

The newmans objection is important, any collection of things can be organised so as to have the structure that we want provided there are the right number of things. That is to say that we can alwyas make the wished structure as long as we have the same number of objects.

the concept of empitical adaquency is introduced, the ramsey sentence is introduced, and its trivialisation.

underlying question, get to the point. structuralims works good, though the newmans objection frefutes the strong struturalist thesis bc it only talsk about cardinality at the end, the application of scrientific structure laks a proper way to connect the formal content of theories to what they refer to.
many attempts have been made to avoid this trivialisation: carnap suggested to take relations to be founded or natural, as presented before. some other authors suggested to add modal operators to caputre intensional realtionaand properties that are lawful. Some other give up referential semantics.

Further notes:

on newmans claim, is justifued since if you only know the structure then you can use any bijection between structures and define new relations that will be isomorphic to the one you already have, if you only have knowledge of structure you can alays impose the same structure. So you can always produce another structre of the same cardinality.
