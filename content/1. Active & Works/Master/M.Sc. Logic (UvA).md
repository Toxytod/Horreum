I currently plan to finish the [M.Sc. Logic](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/) (120 EC) at the University of Amsterdam in two semesters namely in my [[5th Semester]] and [[6th Semester]], in these pages I list all courses I plan to follow. I will also consider to apply for the [[ELLIS Honours Programme]]. The marks I get are listed in one of my [[Storage Information Programs with OOP]], that is [[MoL_Marks (SIP.py)]] and, more simply, in the spreadsheet [MoL Marks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjD1LdGdszllAu5bL-Eybfb4XEd2fofWphFoyJliLjw/edit?usp=sharing).

I also list all courses and other works in [[Index of Master Works]].
