In this page I give a rough projection of the courses I may take in the second semester. To have a better understanding of the structure of my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] one may also read [[5th Semester]] and [[Assume I finish the MoL in one year, what then?]]. I give two different lists of courses for this semester, on is the list of courses I actually foresee to take for credits, given that the big amount of credits already achieved during my [[5th Semester]] semester, allows me to take only those courses required for completing the mathematical track, and those are:
- [Rudiments of Axiomatic Set Theory](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/119766) (1st period), which I may gave waved, since I followed [[Advanced Set Theory (Lecture)]]
- [Model Theory](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/118710) (2nd period), which I may have waved, since I followed [[Model Theory (Lecture)]].

### 6th Semester's Periods (max. list)
Considering the list of the [[5th Semester#M.Sc. Logic (UvA) 5th-6th Sem. Courses]] list, I proceed as in [[5th Semester#5th Semester's Periods]] by giving a division of those courses I could take in the first and second period of the semester. So this list comprehends all courses I am interested in, following all of them within the second semester would already make me exceed the number of required EC. The full list of courses and EC can be found here: [Sheets: M.Sc. Logic Courses Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VPLcicHYGIoovdhYGmbx2yeKaj3IHQ_zJul976Iqbfw/edit?usp=sharing) under 'max. list'.
