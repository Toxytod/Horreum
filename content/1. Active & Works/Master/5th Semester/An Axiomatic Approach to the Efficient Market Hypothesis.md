Talking with David KÃ¼hnenmann, course-mate of the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]], I exposed an intention I had some time ago, that is to attempt to formalise the _Efficient Market Hypothesis_. This may turn out to be my essay for the course in Dynamic Epistemic Logic (during my [[5th Semester]]), I might organise a little research project in that direction too (either at the same time with [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)]] or during the [[6th Semester]]). I would though try not to involve fields I have no knowledge of, like game theory or any financial mathematics, I will adopt an axiomatic approach based on some formal system I decide.
