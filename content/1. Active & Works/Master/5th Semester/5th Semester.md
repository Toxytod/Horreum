#### List of Courses
The semester is divided in two periods, in each one of the periods I plan to have four courses that begin and end in the period (of 6EC each) and three courses that last the whole semester. This means that I would make 24EC per period + 17EC for the latter three courses, hence for a total of 24 + (24 to 36) + 17 = 65 to 77 EC. To this, one shall add the research projects, that I plan to do for 15 EC (see [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)#Bureaucracy]]), getting to a total of 80 to 92EC. This scenario guarantees me the possibility to write the thesis during the [[6th Semester]] and finish the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] in one year.

## Decision Process
Here I keep the reasoning I made for getting to the full list of courses I took in my 5th Semester

During my 5th semester I will both need to finish (or continue) my [[B.Sc. Mathematics (LMU)]] and begin my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]]. In this page I lsit the courses I plan to follow for both degrees, since I will live in Amsterdam, my main focus will be on the M.Sc. but I will study some courses for the B.Sc. and give the exams once I get to Munich by the end of the German semester which is far later the end of the Dutch semester. It is also relevant to consider that my average ECTS per semester is far above the recommended or typical one (see [[Bachelors Outline]]).
### [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] 5th-6th Sem. Courses
First I list all options I have and courses I would like to take, I paste the links from the [Courses List](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course). There are also courses that will be offered during my [[6th Semester]].
##### Very First Priority
These are courses that I would follow even if couldn't count as credits. Other than in  [Philosophy of Mathematics](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/114778), I have no basis in [Type Theory](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/119655), [Topos Theory](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/119390),  [Proof Theory](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/118880) and [Recursion theory](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/118711) though I heard frequently about these fields and need an introduction to those. I also never had a proper course in [Philosophy of Mathematics](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/114778) nor in [Philosophy of Science](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/119209).

#### 5th Semester's Periods (max. list)
Now I consider mostly the courses in [[5th Semester#Very First Priority]] and [[5th Semester#First Priority]] that take place in the first semester (i.e. my [[5th Semester]]) and divide them in the three parts of the Dutch semester, since some of the courses may cover more than a period, the the lists are not disjoint. I also order the courses for priority in each list and give the number of EC in parenthesis (avoiding double counting). Consider that this is meant to be a maximal list in which I count all courses I am interested in, there will most probably be relevant cuts before the [[5th Semester#Final Choice of Courses]], The full list of courses and EC can be found here: [Sheets: M.Sc. Logic Courses Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VPLcicHYGIoovdhYGmbx2yeKaj3IHQ_zJul976Iqbfw/edit?usp=sharing) under 'max. list'.

#### Exemption from Mandatory Courses
I suppose to be exempted from the two mandatory courses: [Introduction to Modal Logic](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/118738) & [Mathematical Proof Methods for Logic](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/119339), here I list the relevant courses I followed in the fields:

Regarding [Introduction to Modal Logic](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course#) I followed [[Modal Logic (Lecture)]], a course of the Master in Philosophy of Science and Logic at the MCMP at the LMU and got 1.3 (1.0 is the best and 4.0 the worst mark).

Reading the [Mathematical Proof Methods for Logic](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025-en/search-course/course/119339) content I see all points were either already covered in the very first course in logic (i.e. Logic I at the LMU) or taught the [[Model Theory (Lecture)]]. Other relevant courses are Philosophy of Logic (see [[What a Logic Could not Be]]) and also the Seminar in Mathematical Logic by Prof. Schwichtenberg in which we learned how to use [minlog](https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~logik/minlog/). In particular three points have been presented as the core of the course _Completeness & Soundness_ which I had in the basic logic course for classical logic and have seen for a decent amount of modal logics too in [[Modal Logic (Lecture)]]; then _Mathematical Induction_ which is given as obvious for any of the mathematical courses I gave in the last year, it has been first presented both in Analysis I and Linear Algebra I; and finally _Categoricity & Definability_ which I have seen in depth in [[Model Theory (Lecture)]], also, regarding the characterisation of theories in particular see [[Structure on Models]] (or in particular notes on [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]] & [[Halvorson, H. (2013), The semantic view, if plausible, is syntactic]]).

Even though I think to have all rights to be exempted from the two mandatory courses, I am wondering whether it is actually convenient to me to be exempted. In fact, even though it would free up time for other more interesting and advanced courses, taking these two courses will take very little time and, hopefully, guarantee me good marks. It still needs to be clarified whether exemption from these courses gives the respective credits or not.
### Final Choice of Courses
In this section I write the final list of courses I follow in my [[5th Semester]]. The presented solution is in line with the average of EC per semester, see [[Bachelors Outline]] and [Sheet: Academic Performance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zl16xKUkKdtIeqCnpCjX7d2LFcM73WJWPsHTkUh2BRc/edit?usp=sharing).
