I followed this course by, Dr. Giorgio Sbardolini during my [[5th Semester]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] for my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]]. I take no lecture notes, as long as the assignments seem to be easy enough, I am already familiar with most of the material.
#### Assignments
Here I list my solutions for the assignments in the respective Overleaf files:
