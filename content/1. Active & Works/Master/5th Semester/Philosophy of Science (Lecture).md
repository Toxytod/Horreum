## Lecture Notes
Here I summarise the content of the lecture and state brief remarks on the papers read during the course.
#### 02.09, I. Logical Empiricism 
- _Frege, Russel, Wittgenstein_: Logic has a tautological nature
	- _Russel_: "math is the only science in which you don't know what you are talking about"
		- content does not matter
- _Vienna Circle_: every principle is either empirically verifiable or logically necessary
- **Carnap**:
	- _Early Carnap_: philosophy as linguistic analysis
		- _syntactic_, analysis of the form of reasoning
		- _semantic_, is part of psychology
		- of a word tfae: (i) dedicubility, (ii) conditions of truth, (iii) verifiability, (iv) meaning
			- why? given the following theory
		- scientific theory := set of sentences
		- sentences that are not observational (i.e. theoretical) shall be divisible into observational 
		- strong position _against metaphysics_
- **Syntactic view**
	1. _Axioms_ make a theory
	2. Theorems (sentences) can be derived
	3. Correspondences Rules bond the theorems to the observations
	- _Change in Theory_
		- _Positivists Periodisation_: you do observations given a theory in the background
		- _Kuhn_: a change in the theory, changes the observation
		- _Galisons_: experiments and instruments shall change, accordingly to theories
			- there can be dialogue between sciences,  
- **Semantic view**
	- theories are sets of models
		 - not all theories can be axiomatised
		 - no language dependence
	- see [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]], [[Halvorson, H. (2013), The semantic view, if plausible, is syntactic]], in general [[Structuralism]].
#### 5.09, II. Popper
- **Falsifiability**: empirically provably false
	- necessary statements are not fansifiable
		- what is necessary, might be a metaphysical matter
		- mathematical statements
- observations rely on the theory
- **Lakatos**: falsifiability should be reviewed
	- no guidelines on what to do in response to an anomaly
	- New Criteria
		- _Naive falsificationist_: falsifiable $\to$ acceptable (early Popper)
		- _Sofisticated falsificationist_: falsifiable, (i) progressive, (ii) heuristic value
			- broader view: one should look at research programs, not theories
	- Parts of a theory
		- _Hard Core_: real essence of the theory
		- _Protectvie Belt_: what can change insignificantly
#### 09.09, III. Kuhn
- **Paradigm**: a framework for practicing science shared by the scientists in a particular discipline
	- science is a _social enterprise_
	- theoretical principles & assumptions, methods, tools, 
- science is _conservative_ and seemingly _dogmatic_:
	- Popper is on the opposite side
		- Kuhn is not normative, he describes how sciences are
- _observation is **theory-laden**_, it cannot be completely detached from paradigms
	- _semantic incommensurability_: words get different menaing
	- _methodological incommensurability_: standards of measure and method change
- Critiques to Kuhn:
	- Kuhn's paradigms compete and do not comunicate, that's not true
	- "paradigm" is not a precisely described enough word
	- Lakatos: there are far less emotions involved than Kuhn claims, it's not politics
- a good sci.th. is: (i) accuracy, (ii) consistency, (iii) broad scope, (iv) simplicity, (v) fruitfulness
	- it is not an algorithmic choice, different previous experience gives different valuations
- _Max Weber_: values influence scientists' actions, but (social) science is objective
	- choice of topic is value-laden, research is value-free, application of results is value-laden again
- _Longino_: objective knowledge can result at community level
	- Criteria for objectivity:
		1. recognised avenues for _criticism_ (peer review)
		2. shared _standards_
		3. community is _responsive_
		4. _equality_ of intellectual authority
#### 16.09, IV. Quine
- _Duhem_: there is no _crucial_ experiment, it cannot be _the_ experiment that falsifies the theory
	- "_hypotheses can only be tested in combination with auxiliary assumptions_"
	- even if you believe to have falsified the theory, there could always be an _unconceived alternative_ which saves the theory and of which nobody thought of.
- _Quinde_: [[Quine, V.W. (1951), Two Dogmas]]
	1. _Reductionism_: scientific statements are logically equivalent to statements in empiricist language
		- subj.lang. of immediate experience / obj.lang. of physical things
	2. _Analytic / Synthetic Distinction_: difference between conceptual schemes and facts is of degree only
		- at a certain point, while defining an analytic statement, one will use some experience.  
	- in the end, the two dogmas are equiv.
- _Critique_: 
	- _Prof_: all started with skepticism on meaning, if we have a theory of meaning, problem solved
		- _intention_ of a sentence is in possible worlds semantics
			- max.set s.t. $S$ holds
- *Under-determination*: 
	1. _Empirically equivalent_: same observational sentences
	2. _Theoretically inequivalent_: different theoretical sentences
	- hence theory is under-determined by the empirical data.
#### 23.09, V. Scientific Explanation & Understanding
- before '48: explanation is not a philosophical topic for logical empiricists.
- _C. Hempel_, 1948: covering law model, epistemic explanation
	- deductive argument: conditions & general laws explain (deductively prove) the phenomenon.
		- only general laws prove only general things
	- Conditions of adequacy
		1. _logical consequence_ {can you actually formalise the conditions? perhaps the general laws}
		2. _general law_, to guarantee necessity {trivially take spatio-temporally bounded general laws?}
		3. explanans must have _empirical content_
		4. _true_ metaphysically {empirically accessible?}
	- No need of causation, this is more general
	- Problems:
		- It is not clear what explains what, one can change arguments and have symmetries
		- One get to correlations rather than explenations
	- Alternatives
		- _causation_ is needed to explain
			- Hume: deletes cause
				- Hume, _counterfactual_: if no $A$, then no $B$, hence $A$ causes $B$
				- Hume, _regularity theory_: usually the sun rises.
			- De Regt: causation is one way, not the only one
		- _unification_ of how phenomena fit in a broader pattern
			- {this could be deductive, general law give the frame, conditions the instance
			- -: not really, not as formal and you can already assume $E$ to have happened}
		- _pragmatic_, basically contextualism
		- _scientific explanation_ requires understanding
- Understanding:
	- _Hempel's Eliminativism_: understanding is matter of the subject, it is psychological.
	- _Khalifa's Reductvism_: having an explanation could be enough
		- _Lipton_: need to know the cause
		- _De Regt_: have an oracle who, you know, tells you the truth, you have still no understanding
	- _Carnap_: in order to have understanding one should
		1. capability of _use_ for the description of facts
		2. _metaphysical_ understanding (refused)
		3. knowing semantic _truth conditions_
	- _van Fraassen_:
		- explanation & understanding are part of the pragmatic, subjective.
		- explanation is irreducible and special to each subject.
		- explanation is not a relation between _theory_ and _fact_, it is a three term, with also _context_.
	- _De Regt_: _Pragmatic use of Understanding_
		- _macro-level_: science as a whole
		- _meso-level_: scientific community
		- _micro-level_: individuals
		- Closely related to
