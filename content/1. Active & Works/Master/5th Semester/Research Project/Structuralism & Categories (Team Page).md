This is a subpage of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)]].

Given the diversity [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Project Structure & Goals]] I think that there are three main fields we would need all student-force needed to best accomplish the end of the project:
- _Philosophers_: in particular experts in Philosophy of Science, but also generally in epistemology, metaphysics & ontology and also logic & foundations of mathematics.
- _Mathematicians_: mainly students who have expertise in Category Theory and related fields. 
- _Physicists_: anyone with a solid background in mathematical physics (I know so little that I do not even know which fields in particular are relevant, so we desperately need physicists!)
### The Team
Other than me (I present myself already in [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Personal Resources of the Project]]), I will list here the other teammates. There currently are a few candidates, I will take the choice of the team more seriously once the supervision is guaranteed (see [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)]].
##### The Structure of the Work
We will mainly work during the third block, as a research project at the UvA should be meant to be (at least for the Master of Logic, if that were not the case for MSc. Physics, we will find some solutions). Though, I plan to organise some meetings, perhaps at the beginning of the second period, when things will be decently calm again, to have all the basics in the field and plan the project together. This will probably consist of 3 - 5 times in which we meet at the Science Park to discuss papers we read before (just like a reading group). We will establish the papers together with the supervisors, but with all probability there will be: [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]].

Each one of the student, according to the plans we will make while moving on, should be able to decide the amount of work they're willing to put into the project and get the respective credits. All of this will be asked to the supervisors (see [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)#Organisational Q&A]]).
