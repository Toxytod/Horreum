## Content Production
For better understanding see [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]] & [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Active Roles]].
### Claim Tracks
- _By presenting alternative identity criteria on semantic theories, I aim to dismantle Halvorson's argument_ ([[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]])_, which I accuse of failing to consider the actual multiplicity of possible identities._ (more on [[Structure on Models]])
	- **Developer**: S. Testino
	- **Writer**: S. Testino
- S. Testino: _Different syntactical theories are often different in different languages having a common set-theoretic (/categorical) grounding, a formal account of translations between languages is necessary._ (see [[Bachelor Thesis]])
	- **Developer**: S. Testino 
	- **Writer**: S. Testino
- A. Sittoni: a ton of technical relevant in category theory can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-PKOMLwWCvZb8dQ43dpHyWLGiw2vnQJO). Andrea will not directly participate to the project, but can certainly answer questions about the claim he pointed to in his thesis, which we may develop within the project.

### Background Tracks
For better understanding see [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]].
- **Category Theory**: starting from what can be found in a standard book in Category Theory (like [[Category Theory (Lecture)]]), we present all required definition to get to the notion of Morita Equivalence. The approach to this introduction can be purely mathematical, i.e. written as a commented serie of definitions and results.
	- **Writer**: `Empty`
- **Structuralism: Semantic & Syntactic View**: with a more philosophical taste, we should presente the underlying assumptions of structuralism referring to the main papers on the topic (see [[Structuralism]]).
