This is a subpage of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)]].

Given the diversity [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Project Structure & Goals]] I think that there are three main fields we would need all student-force needed to best accomplish the end of the project:
- _Philosophers_: in particular experts in Philosophy of Science, but also generally in epistemology, metaphysics & ontology and also logic & foundations of mathematics.
- _Mathematicians_: mainly students who have expertise in Category Theory and related fields. 
- _Physicists_: anyone with a solid background in mathematical physics (I know so little that I do not even know which fields in particular are relevant, so we desperately need physicists!)
## The Team
Other than me (I present myself already in [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Personal Resources of the Project]]), I will list here the other teammates. There currently are a few candidates, I will take the choice of the team more seriously once the supervision is guaranteed (see [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)]].
### Overall Structure of the Work
We will mainly work during the third block, as a research project at the UvA should be meant to be (at least for the Master of Logic, if that were not the case for MSc. Physics, we will find some solutions). Though, I plan to organise some meetings, perhaps at the beginning of the second period, when things will be decently calm again, to have all the basics in the field and plan the project together. This will probably consist of 3 - 5 times in which we meet at the Science Park to discuss papers we read before (just like a reading group). We will establish the papers together with the supervisors, but with all probability there will be: [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]].

Each one of the student, according to the plans we will make while moving on, should be able to decide the amount of work they're willing to put into the project and get the respective credits. All of this will be asked to the supervisors (see [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)#Organisational Q&A]]).
### Project's Tracks
In the broader project, there will be some smaller tracks designed by team members, based on the claims weâ€™ve developed during our discussions and paper readings. I divide these tracks into two distinct types. The first are background tracks, which provide foundational concepts on a particular topic without introducing anything new to the existing literature ([[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]]). The second are tracks that present a specific claim on topics previously introduced ([[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]]). It is crucial to maintain harmony between these two types, ensuring that any thesis we put forward is properly supported by prior introduction of the relevant concepts.
##### Background Tracks
- **Category Theory**: starting from what can be found in a standard book in Category Theory (like [[Category Theory (Lecture)]]), we present all required definition to get to the notion of Morita Equivalence. The approach to this introduction can be purely mathematical, i.e. written as a commented serie of definitions and results.
- **Structuralism: Semantic & Syntactic View**: with a more philosophical taste, we should presente the underlying assumptions of structuralism referring to the main papers on the topic.
	- Part of this will be taken and re-elaborated from the essays uploaded in [[Structuralism]].
##### Claim Tracks
These tracks will be the actual essence of the project and the aim of each one of the members of the team is to bring original contributions to their own or some others of the tracks listed here. Each one of the team's members are therefore welcomed to suggest tracks by writing them [here](https://www.overleaf.com/9972377763krshjstwzmwx#d9e0ff).
- S. Testino: _By presenting alternative identity criteria on semantic theories, I aim to dismantle Halvorson's argument_ ([[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]])_, which I accuse of failing to consider the actual multiplicity of possible identities._ (more on [[Structure on Models]])
- S. Testino: _Different syntactical theories are often different in different languages having a common set-theoretic (/categorical) grounding, a formal account of translations between languages is necessary._ (see [[Bachelor Thesis]])
- A. Sittoni: a ton of technical relevant in category theory can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-PKOMLwWCvZb8dQ43dpHyWLGiw2vnQJO). Andrea will not directly participate to the project, but can certainly answer questions about the claim he pointed to in his thesis, which we may develop within the project.
### Project's Roles
The project credits will likely reflect the roles each participant takes, clearly the same person may have multiple roles, the sharing of one role may add some organisational complexity but may be taken into consideration for the more extensive roles.
##### Overseer's Roles
For the most technical parts of the project, it is necessary to have someone that checks that all that have been introduced is correct. Less challenging but still crucially important, the team's members having these roles should also check that the notation among different parts of the project is consistent.
- **Head of Math Oversight**: Ensures that all mathematical proofs, theorems, and lemmas of the whole project are logically sound and accurate. They will be required also to have read _all relevant papers_ in order to ensure full comprehension of the mathematical proofs.
- **Head of Physics Oversight**: Verifies that all physical facts and calculations are scientifically accurate and consistent with established principles. They clearly also required to have covered the whole relevant literature to ensure full comprehension of the matter.

On a less technical side, but still crucial to ensure the best clarity of the project, it is necessary to have people covering these other roles:
- **Head of Overall Coherence**: Ensures that all sections of the project are coherent, that the order and general structure leads to the easiest understanding of the matter.
- **Head of Conceptual Grounding**: Verifies that all notions are properly defined and thoroughly explained, either within the main content or referenced from background material. They should also check again notational consistency, in particular of the more discorsive sections that may be overlooked by HMO and HPO. 
##### Active Roles
These roles are the most essential to the actual construction of the project. Each one of these will be in function of some of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Project's Tracks]], depending on whether they are [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]] or [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]].
- **Idea Developer**: They come up with an original idea presented it to the group and clearly write down a first exposition of the claim. They have then discussed it with all other team's members competent in the field and got "general approval". The idea will then be added to the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]].
- **Idea's Writer**: They write down the proper text getting to the conclusion exposed in one of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]] and ensure that everything they begin with is already presented in one of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]] ensuring notational consistency.
- **Background Writer**: Once taken one of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]], they expose it in the most clear way possible and keeping touch with people writing on the respective [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]].
