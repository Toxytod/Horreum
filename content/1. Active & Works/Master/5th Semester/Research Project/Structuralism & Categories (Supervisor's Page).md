title: Supervisor's Page

This is a subpage of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)]].

In this page all material that will be relevant to the supervisors for the project [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)]] is uploaded and revised. 
## Involvement of the Supervisors
During the project, we will first work together as a united group to ensure that each student has the necessary background to fully understand the basic literature on structuralism and issues related to theoretical equivalence (for the list of papers, see [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Literature to Explore]]). This phase will only require the supervisors to answer some of our questions as we go through the reading material.

In the second phase of the project, some of us will develop original ideas that we decide to write about (see [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Claim Tracks]]). Before moving into the actual writing, we may ask for a meeting where the group member presents their idea and seeks feedback.

Finally, the supervisors will receive a document encompassing the entire project, which will be broken down into each student's individual contributions to meet the requirements of [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)#Bureaucracy]].
## Bureaucracy
While the content and the proper output of the project will be one single organic work involving multiple tracks ([[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Claim Tracks]] & [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Background Tracks]]) written by each one of the group's members, the bureaucracy to get a recognisable research project out of it requires some further steps. Though, the current bureaucratic form of the project, should not confine in any way the intensions of the projects (see [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Project Structure & Goals]]).

Under a solely bureaucratic perspective, the project will be structured as follows: there will be two independent projects and each one of the students participating to each of the projects will be submitting their own document:
- The first project will be supervised by both Prof. van den Berg & Dr. Cinti, each one of the students submitting the sufficient amount of work will receive 6EC (with passed / not passed)
- The second project will be supervised by Dr. Cinti [1] only and will give 6 - 9EC (with passed / not passed) depending on the contributions; the submission for this project clearly must have empty intersection with what submitted for the first project.

[1]: that is, if Dr. Cinti is allowed to supervise a project by himself; this question will be answered within the end of the week.
