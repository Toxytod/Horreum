This is a subpage of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)]].

In this page all material that will be relevant to the supervisors for the project [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)]] is uploaded and revised.
### Organisational Q&A
In particular here are a list of the main questions that should be answered before getting started with the project:
- Is there someone in particular within or outside the ILLC, who you think could give us some particular insights that could be useful for the project?
- Considering [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Hours of Work, Credits and Expected Length]], how many credits would you estimate for the project? Does it get decided before or after the project is done? If there are doubts regarding bureaucratic procedures of this sort, I will directly send an email to Tugba on this.
#### To the Administration
1. Am I allowed to organise a research project that involves other students too? 
	- Is it possible to make it so that, every research project of each student is independent so that the amount of credits and work done by each student can vary significantly?
2. How is the amount of credits for the project determined? Is just the supervisor the one deciding how much it will be valued?
#### To Prof. van den Berg
- Are you interested in supervising the project? To answer, you may consider:
	- The presentation of the project as in [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Project Structure & Goals]] 
	- Despite the high EC of the project ([[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Hours of Work, Credits and Expected Length]]), we expect to work autonomously and supervision will be also shared with Dr. Enrico Cinti.
- If not, is there some other member of the faculty in your field you would suggest?
#### To Dr. Cinti
All questions have been answered in the last call.
#### Literature Q&A
Clearly, any suggestion of literature is really welcomed, in particular there are some specific topics we are interested in that we would like to investigate more in depth but currently do not have a list of papers to read on it.
###### Category Theory
- Do you think that the literature on Morita Equivalence is accessible to students who completed the course in Category Theory? If not, is there some resource you would suggest to get to the required level?
- It may be useful to have some knowledge on the processes used to _translate_ the mathematical praxis from the familiar set-theoretic foundation to the categorical one. In particular, this may be employed to have a more _categorical_ understanding of those scientific theories which have already been formalised in standard (hence set-theoretic) mathematics. I imagine such a literature may be found in categorical foundations of mathematics.
###### Philosophy of Science
Most literature questions have already been addressed, new ones will certainly come up.
