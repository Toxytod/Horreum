### People
- Josje: Technical Categor-Theoretic parts should be supervised by her.
- Bardo: Might be the only one I know to also be able to work on the intersection of both fields
- Jennifer: Physics!! But also Philosophy
**I should ask to**:
- David: Category Theory (idk if he knows / cares about phi.sci)
- PHYSICIANS!!
- spam in groupchats with google form.

# TODO
- [ ] Write to Chinese cool guy
- [ ] Spam messages around (?)
- [ ] Make undecided people decide 
- [ ] Bureaucratic confirmation from Jennifer
- [ ] To: Cinti & Tugba, can you supervise?
- [x] Update team's page


Beuracracy:
- One project supervised by Benno & Enrico, 6EC to each one of the participants
- One project supervised by Enrico only, 6 - 9 ECs to each one of the participants (Q: can Enrico supervise the project?)
### Organisational Q&A
In particular here are a list of the main questions that should be answered before getting started with the project:
- Is there someone in particular within or outside the ILLC, who you think could give us some particular insights that could be useful for the project?
- Considering [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Hours of Work, Credits and Expected Length]], how many credits would you estimate for the project? Does it get decided before or after the project is done? 
- Is it possible to make it so that, every research project of each student is independent so that the amount of credits and work done by each student can vary significantly?
- Is it possible to receive a mark for the project instead of just to pass the module?
#### To Prof. van den Berg
- Are you interested in supervising the project? To answer, you may consider:
	- The presentation of the project as in [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Project Structure & Goals]] 
	- Despite the high EC of the project ([[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Hours of Work, Credits and Expected Length]]), we expect to work autonomously and supervision will be also shared with Dr. Enrico Cinti.
- If not, is there some other member of the faculty in your field you would suggest?

If the thing gets big enough, I may want to have some roles so that everyone knows what their job is, in particular I need:
- **Responsible of Math Supervision**: check that all proofs, theorems and lemmas are sound
- **Responsible of Physics Supervision**: check facts are true
- **Responsible of Overall Coherence**: that everything fits
- **Responsible of Grounding**: check that every notion is defined & well explained either in the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]] itself or in some of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]].
- **Writer** of a single Track
- **Cowriter** of a single Track, needs to check that it makes sense, not necessary for all.

The project credits will likely reflect the roles each participant takes.
#### **Overseer's Roles**
These roles are primarily focused on technical accuracy and correctness:

- **Head of Math Oversight**: Ensures that all mathematical proofs, theorems, and lemmas are logically sound and accurate.
- **Head of Physics Oversight**: Verifies that all physical facts and calculations are scientifically accurate and consistent with established principles.

In contrast, the following roles ensure coherence and clarity across the work:

- **Head of Overall Coherence**: Ensures that all sections of the project fit together logically and consistently without contradictions.
- **Head of Conceptual Grounding**: Verifies that all notions are properly defined and thoroughly explained, either within the main content or referenced from background material.

#### **Active Roles**
These positions focus on content creation and development:

- **Writer of a Single Track**: Responsible for creating the primary content of a specific track.
- **Cowriter of a Single Track**: Assists in ensuring clarity and coherence in a particular track.
### Paths to Explore
- Sittoni 25.09, 21:00 whatsapp chat: 
- Reformulation of [[Structure on Models]]
## Rumenta

- Max: a little but no
- Josje: interested
- ask Sittoni, has 
- tipo tedesco interessato

To do after upload:
1. spamma ad amici
2. mail a prof (magari dopo averci parlato post lezione)

### Questions
##### First Organisation Steps towards Realisation
1. Ask Dr. Sebastian de Haro Oll√© and Prof. Benno van den Berg for approval
	1. Is it doable with satisfactory depth and completeness in 6 weeks? (I am counting Christmas vacation, in which I will begin reading the literature and determine potential research tracks for other students to collaborate)
	2. Do you have any literature to suggest? (Perhaps other related topics, or further papers in the same field. It would also help to have, particularly on the categorical side, some introduction to the technical skills required)
	3. Do you have any member of ILLC or other researcher to suggest? (Could be both for co-supervision or just for a one-time discussion on the topic with me and potentially other students involved)
	4. Does the field I described well fit your research interests? (Connected to the question above, if the field were not within your field of research, do you have somebody else to suggest, within or outside of the ILLC?)
	5. How many EC would you estimate? (Considering the remarks made above on the amount of pages the work will consist of, hours I plan to invest in and papers I plan to read before)
		6. How does participation of other students influence it? (considering that it would imply a proportionally larger amount of work, not delegation of present work but development of new ideas and branches of research)
2. Team Coordination
	1. Begin to read some literature, whatever is vaguely needed to make the sketch of a plan.
	2. Share this page to the group-chats of Category Theory and Philosophy of Science and search students willing to join the project.
		1. Make a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdx_ATY579NgdwSeGapf1_-P9XYiqg6BDwgNxsD1U4_V4FzEA/viewform?usp=sf_link) with interests, competence area and background and select in case too many people wanted to participate.
	3. Schedule from two to five discussion-meetings with the other students on those papers that will be relevant for the project, in order of priority:
		1. [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]]
		2. [Criteria of Identity and Structural Ontology](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hannes-Leitgeb-2/publication/31349684_Criteria_of_Identity_and_Structuralist_Ontology/links/00463534fdb154f8b7000000/Criteria-of-Identity-and-Structuralist-Ontology.pdf?origin=publicationDetail&_sg%5B0%5D=ulrFKJxSo5jaNeCcC_G-SfIm5cfSOghXDvamINp01-TwUpbBUL2LZjzXUmEE_TSkJL4KY8RIQLMb78iVP7Yv9g.d4mRcbQrbo2MXHb7VkwdtNFfg3MZgisp3B7yGzzuAeAobShv-_XM3l4jFIBw5uU7fLgm5lNQGoWR08qbtX3w3g&_sg%5B1%5D=h_I-RdO0AXbmNUQr62JiRf-9ii05sny7fCG1xftvDZBrgPNtrjcbRebTln1M1wXcSNT3eNjdXzOCy3RgIQZTt-cSGX6SxWoaeZzrtxlZotb0.d4mRcbQrbo2MXHb7VkwdtNFfg3MZgisp3B7yGzzuAeAobShv-_XM3l4jFIBw5uU7fLgm5lNQGoWR08qbtX3w3g&_iepl=&_rtd=eyJjb250ZW50SW50ZW50IjoibWFpbkl0ZW0ifQ%3D%3D&_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOiJwYWdlSGVhZGVyIn19) (?)
		3. One text selected by [[Bas van Fraassen]]
		4. Eventually, for discussion: (agree or disagree with my strong position)
			1. [[Structure on Models]]
			2. [[Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation]]
	4. Have a final discussion so that, by the end of it, only those students that have their own topic of research are selected and combine a complete plan of the whole research project.
		1. Each student shall have their own plan and schedule
			- This will be submitted before the begin of the Christmas Vacation to the supervisors so that they can estimate the EC that will be assigned to each one of the students.
		2. We organise some check-points during the 3rd period so that we can discuss the present state of the work.

###### Category Theory
- Do you think that the literature on Morita Equivalence is accessible to students who completed the course in Category Theory? If not, is there some resource you would suggest to get to the required level?
- It may be useful to have some knowledge on the processes used to _translate_ the mathematical praxis from the familiar set-theoretic foundation to the categorical one. In particular, this may be employed to have a more _categorical_ understanding of those scientific theories which have already been formalised in standard (hence set-theoretic) mathematics. I imagine such a literature may be found in categorical foundations of mathematics.
###### Philosophy of Science
Most literature questions have already been addressed, new ones will certainly come up.
