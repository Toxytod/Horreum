Here I report all the tasks I did and pages I published on this website to fully organise this first project. Since the organisational side of it, other than the content, has been certainly challenging, I imagine this page may be interesting to some.
## The First Prospect
#### First Organisation Steps towards Realisation
1. Ask Dr. Sebastian de Haro Ollé and Prof. Benno van den Berg for approval
	1. Is it doable with satisfactory depth and completeness in 6 weeks? (I am counting Christmas vacation, in which I will begin reading the literature and determine potential research tracks for other students to collaborate)
	2. Do you have any literature to suggest? (Perhaps other related topics, or further papers in the same field. It would also help to have, particularly on the categorical side, some introduction to the technical skills required)
	3. Do you have any member of ILLC or other researcher to suggest? (Could be both for co-supervision or just for a one-time discussion on the topic with me and potentially other students involved)
	4. Does the field I described well fit your research interests? (Connected to the question above, if the field were not within your field of research, do you have somebody else to suggest, within or outside of the ILLC?)
	5. How many EC would you estimate? (Considering the remarks made above on the amount of pages the work will consist of, hours I plan to invest in and papers I plan to read before)
		6. How does participation of other students influence it? (considering that it would imply a proportionally larger amount of work, not delegation of present work but development of new ideas and branches of research)
2. Team Coordination
	1. Begin to read some literature, whatever is vaguely needed to make the sketch of a plan.
	2. Share this page to the group-chats of Category Theory and Philosophy of Science and search students willing to join the project.
		1. Make a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdx_ATY579NgdwSeGapf1_-P9XYiqg6BDwgNxsD1U4_V4FzEA/viewform?usp=sf_link) with interests, competence area and background and select in case too many people wanted to participate.
	3. Schedule from two to five discussion-meetings with the other students on those papers that will be relevant for the project, in order of priority:
		1. [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]]
		2. [Criteria of Identity and Structural Ontology](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hannes-Leitgeb-2/publication/31349684_Criteria_of_Identity_and_Structuralist_Ontology/links/00463534fdb154f8b7000000/Criteria-of-Identity-and-Structuralist-Ontology.pdf?origin=publicationDetail&_sg%5B0%5D=ulrFKJxSo5jaNeCcC_G-SfIm5cfSOghXDvamINp01-TwUpbBUL2LZjzXUmEE_TSkJL4KY8RIQLMb78iVP7Yv9g.d4mRcbQrbo2MXHb7VkwdtNFfg3MZgisp3B7yGzzuAeAobShv-_XM3l4jFIBw5uU7fLgm5lNQGoWR08qbtX3w3g&_sg%5B1%5D=h_I-RdO0AXbmNUQr62JiRf-9ii05sny7fCG1xftvDZBrgPNtrjcbRebTln1M1wXcSNT3eNjdXzOCy3RgIQZTt-cSGX6SxWoaeZzrtxlZotb0.d4mRcbQrbo2MXHb7VkwdtNFfg3MZgisp3B7yGzzuAeAobShv-_XM3l4jFIBw5uU7fLgm5lNQGoWR08qbtX3w3g&_iepl=&_rtd=eyJjb250ZW50SW50ZW50IjoibWFpbkl0ZW0ifQ%3D%3D&_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOiJwYWdlSGVhZGVyIn19) (?)
		3. One text selected by [[Bas van Fraassen]]
		4. Eventually, for discussion: (agree or disagree with my strong position)
			1. [[Structure on Models]]
			2. [[Horsten, L. (2010), Having an Interpretation]]
	4. Have a final discussion so that, by the end of it, only those students that have their own topic of research are selected and combine a complete plan of the whole research project.
		1. Each student shall have their own plan and schedule
			- This will be submitted before the begin of the Christmas Vacation to the supervisors so that they can estimate the EC that will be assigned to each one of the students.
		2. We organise some check-points during the 3rd period so that we can discuss the present state of the work.
#### Questions & People to Reach Out
In particular here are a list of the main questions that should be answered before getting started with the project:
- Is there someone in particular within or outside the ILLC, who you think could give us some particular insights that could be useful for the project?
- Considering [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Hours of Work, Credits and Expected Length]], how many credits would you estimate for the project? Does it get decided before or after the project is done? 
- Is it possible to make it so that, every research project of each student is independent so that the amount of credits and work done by each student can vary significantly?
- Is it possible to receive a mark for the project instead of just to pass the module?
##### To Prof. van den Berg
- Are you interested in supervising the project? To answer, you may consider:
	- The presentation of the project as in [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Project Structure & Goals]] 
	- Despite the high EC of the project ([[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Hours of Work, Credits and Expected Length]]), we expect to work autonomously and supervision will be also shared with Dr. Enrico Cinti.
- If not, is there some other member of the faculty in your field you would suggest?

If the thing gets big enough, I may want to have some roles so that everyone knows what their job is, in particular I need:
- **Responsible of Math Supervision**: check that all proofs, theorems and lemmas are sound
- **Responsible of Physics Supervision**: check facts are true
- **Responsible of Overall Coherence**: that everything fits
- **Responsible of Grounding**: check that every notion is defined & well explained either in the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]] itself or in some of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]].
- **Writer** of a single Track
- **Cowriter** of a single Track, needs to check that it makes sense, not necessary for all.

The project credits will likely reflect the roles each participant takes.
#### How to Handle People Once I have them
##### **Overseer's Roles**
These roles are primarily focused on technical accuracy and correctness:

- **Head of Math Oversight**: Ensures that all mathematical proofs, theorems, and lemmas are logically sound and accurate.
- **Head of Physics Oversight**: Verifies that all physical facts and calculations are scientifically accurate and consistent with established principles.

In contrast, the following roles ensure coherence and clarity across the work:

- **Head of Overall Coherence**: Ensures that all sections of the project fit together logically and consistently without contradictions.
- **Head of Conceptual Grounding**: Verifies that all notions are properly defined and thoroughly explained, either within the main content or referenced from background material.

##### **Active Roles**
These positions focus on content creation and development:

- **Writer of a Single Track**: Responsible for creating the primary content of a specific track.
- **Cowriter of a Single Track**: Assists in ensuring clarity and coherence in a particular track.

## Building Up the Team
The [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)]] on 16.10 was the following
This is a subpage of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)]].
### Team's Page: 16.10
Given the diversity [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Project Structure & Goals]] I think that there are three main fields we would need all student-force needed to best accomplish the end of the project:
- _Philosophers_: in particular experts in Philosophy of Science, but also generally in epistemology, metaphysics & ontology and also logic & foundations of mathematics.
- _Mathematicians_: mainly students who have expertise in Category Theory and related fields. 
- _Physicists_: anyone with a solid background in mathematical physics (I know so little that I do not even know which fields in particular are relevant, so we desperately need physicists!)

Important details on [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)#Bureaucracy]] are available on the [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)]], e.g. how many ECs one can get, deadline ecc.
#### The Team
Other than me (I present myself already in [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)#Personal Resources of the Project]]), I will list here the other teammates. There currently are a few candidates, I will take the choice of the team more seriously once the supervision is guaranteed (see [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)]].
#### Overall Structure of the Work
We will mainly work during the third block, as a research project at the UvA should be meant to be (at least for the Master of Logic, if that were not the case for MSc. Physics, we will find some solutions). Though, I plan to organise some meetings, perhaps at the beginning of the second period, when things will be decently calm again, to have all the basics in the field and plan the project together. This will probably consist of 3 - 5 times in which we meet at the Science Park to discuss papers we read before (just like a reading group). We will establish the papers together with the supervisors, but with all probability there will be: [[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]].

Each one of the student, according to the plans we will make while moving on, should be able to decide the amount of work they're willing to put into the project and get the respective credits. All of this will be asked to the supervisors (see [[Structuralism & Categories (Supervisor's Page)#Organisational Q&A]]).
#### Project's Tracks
In the broader project, there will be some smaller tracks designed by team members, based on the claims we’ve developed during our discussions and paper readings. I divide these tracks into two distinct types. The first are background tracks, which provide foundational concepts on a particular topic without introducing anything new to the existing literature ([[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]]). The second are tracks that present a specific claim on topics previously introduced ([[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]]). It is crucial to maintain harmony between these two types, ensuring that any thesis we put forward is properly supported by prior introduction of the relevant concepts.
##### Background Tracks
- **Category Theory**: starting from what can be found in a standard book in Category Theory (like [[Category Theory (Lecture)]]), we present all required definition to get to the notion of Morita Equivalence. The approach to this introduction can be purely mathematical, i.e. written as a commented serie of definitions and results.
- **Structuralism: Semantic & Syntactic View**: with a more philosophical taste, we should presente the underlying assumptions of structuralism referring to the main papers on the topic.
	- Part of this will be taken and re-elaborated from the essays uploaded in [[Structuralism]].
##### Claim Tracks
These tracks will be the actual essence of the project and the aim of each one of the members of the team is to bring original contributions to their own or some others of the tracks listed here. Each one of the team's members are therefore welcomed to suggest tracks by writing them [here](https://www.overleaf.com/9972377763krshjstwzmwx#d9e0ff).
- S. Testino: _By presenting alternative identity criteria on semantic theories, I aim to dismantle Halvorson's argument_ ([[Halvorson, H. (2012), What Scientific Theories Could not Be]])_, which I accuse of failing to consider the actual multiplicity of possible identities._ (more on [[Structure on Models]])
- S. Testino: _Different syntactical theories are often different in different languages having a common set-theoretic (/categorical) grounding, a formal account of translations between languages is necessary._ (see [[Bachelor Thesis]])
- A. Sittoni: a ton of technical relevant in category theory can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-PKOMLwWCvZb8dQ43dpHyWLGiw2vnQJO). Andrea will not directly participate to the project, but can certainly answer questions about the claim he pointed to in his thesis, which we may develop within the project.
#### Project's Roles
The project credits will likely reflect the roles each participant takes, clearly the same person may have multiple roles, the sharing of one role may add some organisational complexity but may be taken into consideration for the more extensive roles. In the following section I present the roles, while in [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)]]
##### Overseer's Roles
For the most technical parts of the project, it is necessary to have someone that checks that all that have been introduced is correct. Less challenging but still crucially important, the team's members having these roles should also check that the notation among different parts of the project is consistent.
- **Head of Math Oversight**: Ensures that all mathematical proofs, theorems, and lemmas of the whole project are logically sound and accurate. They will be required also to have read _all relevant papers_ in order to ensure full comprehension of the mathematical proofs.
- **Head of Physics Oversight**: Verifies that all physical facts and calculations are scientifically accurate and consistent with established principles. They clearly also required to have covered the whole relevant literature to ensure full comprehension of the matter.

On a less technical side, but still crucial to ensure the best clarity of the project, it is necessary to have people covering these other roles:
- **Head of Overall Coherence**: Ensures that all sections of the project are coherent, that the order and general structure leads to the easiest understanding of the matter.
- **Head of Conceptual Grounding**: Verifies that all notions are properly defined and thoroughly explained, either within the main content or referenced from background material. They should also check again notational consistency, in particular of the more discorsive sections that may be overlooked by HMO and HPO. 
##### Active Roles
These roles are the most essential to the actual construction of the project. Each one of these will be in function of some of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Project's Tracks]], depending on whether they are [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Background Tracks]] or [[Structuralism & Categories (Team's Page)#Claim Tracks]].
- **Idea Developer**: They come up with an original idea presented it to the group and clearly write down a first exposition of the claim. They have then discussed it with all other team's members competent in the field and got "general approval". The idea will then be added to the [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Claim Tracks]].
- **Idea's Writer**: They write down the proper text getting to the conclusion exposed in one of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Claim Tracks]] and ensure that everything they begin with is already presented in one of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Background Tracks]], ensuring notational consistency.
- **Background Writer**: Once taken one of the [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Background Tracks]], they expose it in the most clear way possible and keeping touch with people writing on the respective [[Structuralism & Categories (Tracks & Roles)#Claim Tracks]].
