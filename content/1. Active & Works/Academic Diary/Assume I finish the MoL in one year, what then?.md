Before beginning to answer the question that gives the title to this page, I want to analyse under which conditions it actually makes sense to finish the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] in one year, i.e. at the end of the [[6th Semester]]. To proceed, I describe a possible (perhaps even probable) optimal scenario in which I would certainly decide to finish the master in this first year; I will then proceed the discussion assuming that such an optima scenario is actual.
#### The Best Possible World
I would certainly decide to finish the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] in one year, if:
1. By the end of the [[5th Semester]], I have enough credits (that is, neglecting any potential mark below 7.0) so that I can focus on the writing of the thesis for my [[6th Semester]]
	- It would also help to know that I can hand the thesis in around September / October, so that I actually have all the time to work on it.
	- It may also help to consider to have some past courses recognised, like 
		- [[Advanced Set Theory (Lecture)]], which may count as $2.3 \mapsto 7.0$ (see [[Documents#Ludwig Maximilian Universität München]])
		- [[Model Theory (Lecture)]], same as above
		- Philosophy of Logic (LMU), [[What a Logic Could not Be]]
		- Category Theory for the Working Philosopher (LMU), [[Structure on Models]]
		- Philosophy of Physics
2. My average of grades is significantly above 8.0, if I am well-organised, it is uploaded at [[MoL_Marks (SIP.py)]]
3. I have a good Thesis project, that is:
	-  I have, or may have in time, good familiarity with the literature
	- It is in the field in which I want to work in the future

Given these assumptions, before the end of September / October I will be graduated at the ILLC in the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] with honors, perhaps, I will also consider the [[ELLIS Honours Programme]].
## Potential Following Roads
In general, there are three roads that I may consider:
1. Begin a good PhD
2. Stay at the ILLC to do research as a MoL student
3. Try to work for one year

I clearly have preferences among these three scenarios, that is, I would definitely prioritise the first option but only if that is in one of my favourite universities. With a similar approach as above, I almost solely consider the best possible scenario, i.e. I see what I should do to get in a PhD position I would really like; if that will not be the case, I will take into consideration the alternatives.
