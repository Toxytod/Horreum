Before beginning to answer the question that gives the title to this page, I want to analyse under which conditions it actually makes sense to finish the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] in one year, i.e. at the end of the [[6th Semester]]. To proceed, I describe a possible (perhaps even probable) optimal scenario in which I would certainly decide to finish the master in this first year; I will then proceed the discussion assuming that such an optima scenario is actual.
#### The Best Possible World
I would certainly decide to finish the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] in one year, if:
1. By the end of the [[5th Semester]], I have enough credits (that is, neglecting any potential mark below 7.0) so that I can focus on the writing of the thesis for my [[6th Semester]]
	- It would also help to know that I can hand the thesis in around September / October, so that I actually have all the time to work on it.
	- It may also help to consider to have some past courses recognised, like 
		- [[Advanced Set Theory (Lecture)]], which may count as $2.3 \mapsto 7.0$ (see [[Documents#Ludwig Maximilian Universität München]])
		- [[Model Theory (Lecture)]], same as above
		- Philosophy of Logic (LMU), [[What a Logic Could not Be]]
		- Category Theory for the Working Philosopher (LMU), [[Structure on Models]]
		- Philosophy of Physics
2. My average of grades is significantly above 8.0, if I am well-organised, it is uploaded at [[MoL_Marks (SIP.py)]]
3. I have a good Thesis project, that is:
	-  I have, or may have in time, good familiarity with the literature
	- It is in the field in which I want to work in the future

Given these assumptions, before the end of September / October I will be graduated at the ILLC in the [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] with honors, perhaps, I will also consider the [[ELLIS Honours Programme]].
## Potential Following Roads
In general, there are three roads that I may consider:
1. Begin a good PhD
2. Stay at the ILLC to do research as a MoL student
3. Try to work for one year

I clearly have preferences among these three scenarios, that is, I would definitely prioritise the first option but only if that is in one of my favourite universities. With a similar approach as above, I almost solely consider the best possible scenario, i.e. I see what I should do to get in a PhD position I would really like; if that will not be the case, I will take into consideration the alternatives.
### Applying for PhD Positions
Given that I am unsure in which topic I want to write the thesis, I am clearly unsure on the precise filed in which i want to do my PhD and therefore picking one department becomes particularly complicated.

**Complications with US Applications**: there are several difficulties in applying in universities in the US, since I would not have my [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]] completed by that time. Deadlines seem to be around January (at least this is the case for Princeton) and by that time I would have done the first semester, which could actually already be most of the credits other than the thesis. On top of that, I can also submit data linked to the website, which will then be updated (in case marks were still to come by the deadline).
#### Candidate PhD Positions
I divide here the applications I will do in the US and those I will do in Europe, since the deadlines, procedure and general structure of the studies are radically different. In general, I would both appreciate an experience in the US personally and I would also enjoy to have some more taught courses, since I cannot yet feel to have a broad enough background to properly do research.

**PhD Position in the US**: here I list all those that may be interesting and to which I consider applying:
- _Berkley University_: [link](https://logic.berkeley.edu/admission.html)
- _Carnegie Mellon University_: [link](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/graduate/phd/index.html)
- _Princeton_: [link](https://philosophy.princeton.edu/graduate/special-programs)
	- I would have a strong application due to [[Structuralism & Categories (Homepage)]] with Halvorson
- _Stanford_: [link](https://bulletin.stanford.edu/programs/PHILO-PHD)
	- I followed a course by Prof. Zalta and [Prof. van Bentham](https://philosophy.stanford.edu/people/johan-van-benthem) has history at the ILLC

Q: Is there any other university I should consider?

**PhD Positions in EU**: applying to European positions should be less pressing with deadlines, I consider applying:
- _University of Amsterdam: ILLC_
- _Ludwig Maximilian University: MCMP_
- _Oxford University_: DPhil
- (Vienna?)
- (Constance?)

Q: Is there any other university I should consider? Perhaps outside US & EU?
