> "Frumentum in acervis optime servatur, si in loco salubri ponatur, inaequabili tempestate nec alternis imbribus aut solibus vexato. Nam neque exustis infringi illud convenit neque humidis, priusquam bis singulis diebus terantur. In horreis non minus diligenter exculcato quam in terris exarato bene servatur. Sed in acervis per se natura vigilat, mures praeterea arcentur."

Plinius Secundus, *Naturalis Historia*, Liber XVIII, Caput XXX

The meaning of "Horreum", the name of the website, is to be found in Latin, in which this word denotes a small storeroom meant for objects and food of any kind. Often, like above, it denotes a granary and it symbolises the care adopted in preserving the notes collected here.

This website has as a first main to present my academic and professional work. The former has already many resourced dedicated, like [[Index of Bachelor Works]] and [[M.Sc. Logic (UvA)]]; regarding the latter I will collect more information once I make more experience, for now see [[Jobs Index]]. Other than this, I got used to posting on this website other details not concerning either academia nor work, these are listed in [[ExAcademia Index]].

The home link of the website is [horreum.pages.dev](https://horreum.pages.dev/).
